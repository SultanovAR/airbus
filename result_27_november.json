[{"title": "A220-100.txt", "text": "A220-100(A220):\n\nThe smallest jetliner in Airbus\u2019 in-production product line, the A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) was built from the ground up to serve the 100-135 seat market with unbeatable efficiency and comfort. With broad seats, plenty of overhead storage space and large windows, it\u2019s a single-aisle aircraft that feels like a widebody jet. The extensive use of advanced aluminium in the fuselage \u2013 along with advanced composites in the wings, empennage and rear fuselage \u2013 reduces weight and increases corrosion resistance, resulting in better maintainability. These modern structural materials make up 70 percent of the aircraft\u2019s primary structure, delivering weight savings for reduced fuel burned, with an accompanying reduction of CO2 and NOx emissions. Powered by Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines specifically designed for the family, the A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) can connect distant airports with its 3,100 nm range and best-in-class airfield performance. Using a takeoff field length as short as 1,220 metres, the A220 Family is ideal for hot-and-high and city-centre airport operations; in fact, the A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) and A220-300 are the largest aircraft able to operate in the constrained environment of London City Airport. Boasting one of the best views in the sky, the extra-large windows on the A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) are abundant \u2013 more than one per row \u2013 and the flying experience is a peaceful one. A220 Family aircraft are recognised for their low noise levels, providing a quiet cabin as well. Wide seats combined with ample overhead storage create personal space without compromise, and the cabin management system provides crews with easy, intuitive control of the aircraft\u2019s interior environment, including entertainment offerings and mood lighting to ensure a delightful passenger experience. The Airbus A220, previously known as Bombardier CSeries or A220-100(A220) (or C Series), is a family of narrow-body, twin-engine, medium-range jet airliners marketed by Airbus but designed and originally built by the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace. Following Airbus involvement the aircraft are built by CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP). The 108 to 133-seat A220-100(A220) (formerly ( A220-100(A220) )) made its maiden flight on 16 September 2013, was awarded an initial type certification by Transport Canada on 18 December 2015 and entered service on 15 July 2016 with Swiss Global Air Lines. At service entry operators realized a 21% lower fuel burn for the CS300 in replacing 32-year-old Boeing 737-300s, with a dependability above 99.3%, and 25% lower costs than the RJ100 for the ( A220-100(A220) ), while the passengers' and pilots' feedback is positive for the cabin and flight controls. Airbus purchased a 50.01% majority stake in the CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) program in October 2017, with the deal closing in July 2018. As part of the deal, Bombardier retained a 31% stake in the aircraft and Investissement Qu\u00e9bec retained a 19% stake. Airbus plans to open a second assembly line for the aircraft at its Mobile, Alabama factory. When Fokker, which produced the Fokker 100 100-seat short-haul aircraft, was in difficulty, discussions began with Bombardier on 5 February 1996. After evaluating Fokker's opportunities and challenges, Bombardier announced an end to the acquisition process on 27 February. which made its first flight in January 2002, as Boeing had the 737NG-600 first delivered in September 1998. Feasibility study: Bombardier appointed Gary Scott on 8 March 2004 to evaluate the creation of a New Commercial. Program launch: On 31 January 2007, Bombardier announced that work on the aircraft would continue, with entry into service planned for 2013. Program schedule: In November 2009, first flight was expected in 2012. Flight testing: An extensive update on the CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) program was presented on 7 March 2013; the first \"flight test vehicle\" (FTV) was displayed in an almost completed state, along with three other FTVs in various states of assembly and confirming the 160-seat \"Extra Capacity\" version of the CS300, featuring two sets of over wing. Program support: In October 2015 Airbus confirmed that it had turned down Bombardier's offer to sell a majority share of the CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) to them. Bombardier then said it would explore alternatives. Just days before, the Government of Quebec reiterated that it would be willing to provide Bombardier with financial aid, should the company request it. Richard Aboulafia, Teal Group vice president of analysis, and a long-time critic of the CSeries or A220-100(A220), indicated that the cancellation of the program and coverage of losses by the Government of Canada were both likely. Certification: US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency certification for the ( A220-100(A220) ) was granted in June 2016.Production: Production was set to ramp from seven CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) deliveries in 2016 to 30-35 aircraft in 2017 after Pratt & Whitney PW1000G supply and start issues are resolved. Airbus acquisition:\nOn 16 October 2017, Airbus and Bombardier Aerospace announced a partnership on the CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) program, with Airbus acquiring a 50.01% majority stake, Bombardier keeping 31% and Investissement Qu\u00e9bec 19%, to expand in an estimated market of more than 6,000 new 100-150 seat aircraft over 20 years. Airbus's supply chain expertise should save production costs but headquarters and assembly remain in Qu\u00e9bec while U.S. customers would benefit from a second assembly line in Mobile, Alabama. This transaction was subject to regulatory approvals and was expected to be completed in 2018. Airbus takeover: On 8 June, after regulatory approval, Airbus and Bombardier announced that Airbus would take a majority stake on 1 July 2018. The head office, leadership team and primary final assembly line will stay in Mirabel, with its workforce of 2,200. Bombardier will fund the cash shortfalls if required, up to US$610 million from the second half of 2018 to 2021. Operational history: The ( A220-100(A220) ) (now A220-100(A220)) began revenue service on 15 July 2016 with a Swiss International Air Lines flight between Zurich and Paris. Design: The Bombardier CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) aircraft contains a high proportion of composite materials and features larger windows. The CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) cabin features large, rotating overhead storage bins, allowing each passenger to stow a sizeable carry-on bag overhead. Bombardier claims that compared to the cabins of current in-service narrowbody aircraft, the CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) provides airlines with the highest overhead bin volume per passenger and a wider aisle that allows for faster boarding and disembarkation of passengers. \nVariants:\nAirbus A220-100(A220)\t- Marketing designation of the BD-500-1A10 for aircraft from serial number 50011\nMarket: The A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) competes with the Embraer E195-E2, while the -300 stands against the Boeing 737 MAX 7, Airbus A319neo. Boeing dumping petition: On 28 April 2016, Bombardier Aerospace sold 75 CSeries or A220-100(A220) ( A220 ) CS100 firmly plus 50 options to Delta Air Lines. On 27 April 2017, Boeing filed a petition for dumping them at $19.6m each, below their $33.2m production cost.On 9 June 2017, the US International Trade Commission (USITC) found the US industry could be threatened. On 26 September, the US Department of Commerce (DoC) observed subsidies of 220% and will collect deposits based on these. It will add a 80% preliminary anti-dumping duty on top, resulting in a total duty of 300%. The DoC announced its final ruling, a total duty of 292%, on 20 December. On 10 January 2018, the Canadian government filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization against the US.On 26 January 2018, the USITC four commissioners unanimously determined the US industry is not threatened and no duty orders will be issued, overturning the imposed duties. The Commission public report was made available by February 2018.

TEA instantly subleased the aircraft for six weeks to Air Alg\u00e9rie, but continued to operate the aircraft until 1990. It had accommodation for 300 passengers (TEA) or 323 passengers (Air Alg\u00e9rie) with a maximum weight of 132,000 kg and two General Electric CF6-50A engines of 220 kN thrust. The A300B1 was five frames shorter than the later production versions, being only 50.97 m (167.2 ft) in length.\n\nThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and manufactured by Airbus. Formally announced in 1969 and first flying in October 1972, it holds the distinction of being the world's first twin-engined widebody airliner; it was also the first product of Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, now known as Airbus. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum range of 4,070 nautical miles (7,540 km) when fully loaded, depending on model. Development of the A300 began during the 1960s as a European collaborative project between various aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. In September 1967, the participating nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to manufacture the aircraft. The British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. A new agreement was reached between Germany and France on 29 May 1969, and Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce the A300. The type first flew on 28 October 1972. Air France, the launch customer for the A300, introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Following a period of limited customer demand, the A300 achieved several large sales in 1978, after which the type was viewed to have proven itself and orders came in at a steady rate across the next three decades. During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with various freight operators, and several different cargo aircraft variants were produced. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller A310 derivative. The freighter sales for which the A300 had previously competed in later life are instead fulfilled by the A330-200F, a derivative of the newer Airbus A330.\n\nDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, based in the UK, and Sud Aviation of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine of the Hawker Siddeley Trident and an expanded development of the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven designated the BAC Two-Eleven, it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch quite similar aircraft onto the market at the same time, none of them would achieve the volume sales needed to make them viable. In 1965, a British government study, known as the Plowden Report, had found British aircraft production costs to be between 10 and 20 per cent higher than American counterparts due to shorter production runs, which in turn was due to the fractured European market. To overcome this factor, the report recommended the pursuit of multinational collaborative projects between the region's leading aircraft manufacturers. European manufacturers were keen to explore prospective programs; the proposed 260-seat wide-body HBN 100 between Hawker Siddeley, Nord Aviation, and Breguet Aviation being one such example. National governments were also keen to support such efforts amid a belief that American manufacturers could dominate the European Economic Community; in particular, Germany had ambitions for a multinational airliner project to invigorate its aircraft industry, which had declined considerably following the Second World War. During the mid-1960s, both Air France and American Airlines had expressed interest in a short-haul twin-engine wide-body aircraft, indicating a market demand for such an aircraft to be produced. In July 1967, during a high-profile meeting between French, German, and British ministers, an agreement was made for greater cooperation between European nations in the field of aviation technology, and \"for the joint development and production of an airbus\". The word airbus at this point was a generic aviation term for a larger commercial aircraft, and was considered acceptable in multiple languages, including French. Shortly after the July 1967 meeting, French engineer Roger B\u00e9teille was appointed as the technical director of what would become the A300 program, while Henri Ziegler, chief operating office of Sud Aviation, was appointed as the general manager of the organization and German politician Franz Josef Strauss became the chairman of the supervisory board. B\u00e9teille drew up an initial work share plan for the project, under which French firms would produce the aircraft's cockpit, the control systems, and lower-center portion of the fuselage, Hawker Siddeley would manufacture the wings, while German companies would produce the forward, rear and upper part of the center fuselage sections. Addition work included moving elements of the wings being produced in the Netherlands, and Spain producing the horizontal tail plane. An early design goal for the A300 that B\u00e9teille had stressed the importance of was the incorporation of a high level of technology, which would serve as a decisive advantage over prospective competitors. As such, the A300 would feature the first use of composite materials of any passenger aircraft, the leading and trailing edges of the tail fin being composed of glass fibre reinforced plastic. B\u00e9teille opted for English as the working language for the developing aircraft, as well against using Metric instrumentation and measurements, as most airlines already had US-built aircraft. These decisions were partially influenced by feedback from various airlines, such as Air France and Lufthansa, as an emphasis had been placed on determining the specifics of what kind of aircraft that potential operators were seeking. According to Airbus, this cultural approach to market research had been crucial to the company's long term success. On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. At this point, the A300 was only the second major joint aircraft programme in Europe, the first being the Anglo-French Concorde. Under the terms of the memorandum, Britain and France were each to receive a 37.5 per cent work share on the project, while Germany received a 25 per cent share. Sud Aviation was recognized as the lead company for A300, with Hawker Siddeley being selected as the British partner company. At the time, the news of the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back BAC's proposed competitor, the BAC 2-11, despite a preference for the latter expressed by British European Airways (BEA). Another parameter was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by Rolls-Royce to power the proposed airliner; a derivative of the in-development Rolls-Royce RB211, the triple-spool RB207, capable of producing of 47,500 lbf. In December 1968, the French and British partner companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. It had been feared that the original 300-seat proposal was too large for the market, thus it had been scaled down to produce the A250. The dimensional changes involved in the shrink reduced the length of the fuselage by 5.62 meters and the diameter by 0.8 meters, reducing the overall weight by 25 tonnes. For increased flexibility, the cabin floor was raised so that standard LD3 freight containers could be accommodated side-by-side, allowing more cargo to be carried. Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft. It was later renamed the A300B. Perhaps the most significant change of the A300B was that it would not require new engines to be developed, being of a suitable size to be powered by Rolls-Royce's RB211, or alternatively the American Pratt & Whitney JT9D and General Electric CF6 powerplants; this switch was recognized as considerably reducing the project's development costs. To attract potential customers in the US market, it was decided that General Electric CF6-50 engines would power the A300 in place of the British RB207; these engines would be produced in co-operation with French firm Snecma. By this time, Rolls-Royce had been concentrating their efforts upon developing their RB211 turbofan engine instead and progress on the RB207's development had been slow for some time, the firm having suffered due to funding limitations, both of which had been factors in the engine switch decision. On 10 April 1969, a few months after the decision to drop the RB207 had been announced, the British government announced that they would withdraw from the Airbus venture. In response, West Germany proposed to France that they would be willing to contribute up to 50% of the project's costs if France was prepared to do the same. Additionally, the managing director of Hawker Siddeley, Sir Arnold Alexander Hall, decided that his company would remain in the project as a favoured sub-contractor, developing and manufacturing the wings for the A300, which would later become pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights. Hawker Siddeley spent \u00a335 million of its own funds, along with a further \u00a335 million loan from the West German government, on the machine tooling to design and produce the wings.\n\nOn 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner. The intention of the project was to produce an aircraft that was smaller, lighter, and more economical than its three-engine American rivals, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. In order to meet Air France's demands for an aircraft larger than 250-seat A300B, it was decided to stretch the fuselage to create a new variant, designated as the A300B2, which would be offered alongside the original 250-seat A300B, henceforth referred to as the A300B1. On 3 September 1970, Air France signed a letter of intent for six A300s, marking the first order to be won for the new airliner. In the aftermath of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities. On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between A\u00e9rospatiale (the newly merged Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation) of France and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company. In 1971, the consortium was joined by a third full partner, the Spanish firm CASA, who received a 4.2 per cent stake, the other two members reducing their stakes to 47.9 per cent each. In 1979, Britain joined the Airbus consortium via British Aerospace, which Hawker Siddeley had merged into, which acquired a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie with France and Germany each reducing their stakes to 37.9 per cent. Airbus Industrie was initially headquartered in Paris, which is where design, development, flight testing, sales, marketing, and customer support activities were centered; the headquarters was relocated to Toulouse in January 1974. The final assembly line for the A300 was located adjacent to Toulouse Blagnac International Airport. The manufacturing process necessitated transporting each aircraft section being produced by the partner companies scattered across Europe to this one location. The combined use of ferries and roads were used for the assembly of the first A300, however this was time-consuming and not viewed as ideal by Felix Kracht, Airbus Industrie's production director. Kracht's solution was to have the various A300 sections brought to Toulouse by a fleet of Boeing 377-derived Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft, by which means none of the manufacturing sites were more than two hours away. Having the sections airlifted in this manner made the A300 the first airliner to use just-in-time manufacturing techniques, and allowed each company to manufacture its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies. In September 1969, construction of the first prototype A300 began. On 28 September 1972, this first prototype was unveiled to the public, it conducted its maiden flight from Toulouse\u2013Blagnac International Airport on 28 October that year. This maiden flight, which was performed a month ahead of schedule, lasted for one hour and 25 minutes; the captain was Max Fischl and the first officer was Bernard Ziegler, son of Henri Ziegler. On 5 February 1973, the second prototype performed its maiden flight. The flight test program, which involved a total of four aircraft, was relatively problem-free, accumulating 1,580 flight hours throughout. In September 1973, as part of promotional efforts for the A300, the new aircraft was taken on a six-week tour around North America and South America, to demonstrate it to airline executives, pilots, and would-be customers. Amongst the consequences of this expedition, it had allegedly brought the A300 to the attention of Frank Borman of Eastern Airlines, one of the \"big four\" U.S. airlines. On 15 March 1974, type certificates were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service. On 23 May 1974, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification was received. The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974, followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially, the success of the consortium was poor, in part due to the economic consequences of the 1973 oil crisis, but by 1979 there were 81 A300 passenger liners in service with 14 airlines, alongside 133 firm orders and 88 options. Ten years after the official launch of the A300, the company had achieved a 26 per cent market share in terms of dollar value, enabling Airbus Industries to proceed with the development of its second aircraft, the Airbus A310. It was the launch of the Airbus A320 in 1987 that firmly established Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market \u2013 over 400 orders were placed before the narrow-body airliner had flown its first flight, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.\n\nThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body medium-to-long range airliner; it has the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. In 1977, the A300 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft, due to its high performance and safety standards. Another world-first of the A300 is the use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft, which was used on both secondary and later primary airframe structures, decreasing overall weight and improving cost-effectiveness. Other firsts included the pioneering use of center-of-gravity control, achieved by transferring fuel between various locations across the aircraft, and electrically signaled secondary flight controls. The A300 is powered by a pair of underwing turbofan engines, either General Electric CF6 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines; the sole use of underwing engine pods allowed for any suitable turbofan engine to be more readily used. The lack of a third tail-mounted engine, as per the trijet configuration used by some competing airliners, allowed for the wings to be located further forwards and to reduce the size of the vertical stabilizer and elevator, which had the effect of increasing the aircraft's flight performance and fuel efficiency. Airbus partners had employed the latest technology, some of which having been derived from Concorde, on the A300. According to Airbus, new technologies adopted for the airliner were selected principally for increased safety, operational capability, and profitability. Upon entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane, which went on to influence later airliner designs. The technological highlights include: \nAdvanced wings by de Havilland (later BAE Systems) with:\n- Supercritical airfoil section for economical performance\n- advanced aerodynamically efficient flight control surfaces\n- 5.64 m (222 in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 LD3 cargo containers side-by-side\n- Structures made from metal billets, reducing weight\n- First airliner to be fitted with wind shear protection\n- Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing\n- Electrically controlled braking system\nLater A300s incorporated other advanced features such as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which enabled a two-pilot flight crew to fly the aircraft alone without the need for a flight engineer, the functions of which were automated; this two-man cockpit concept was a world-first for a wide-body aircraft. Glass cockpit flight instrumentation, which used cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors to display flight, navigation, and warning information, along with fully digital dual autopilots and digital flight control computers for controlling the spoilers, flaps, and leading-edge slats, were also adopted upon later-built models. Additional composites were also made use of, such as carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), as well as their presence in an increasing proportion of the aircraft's components, including the spoilers, rudder, air brakes, and landing gear doors. Another feature of later aircraft were the addition of wingtip fences, which generated greater aerodynamic performance (first introduced on the A310-300). In addition to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, it is the best selling freight aircraft of all time. Various variants of the A300 were built to meet customer demands, often for diverse roles such as aerial refueling tankers, freighter models (new-build and conversions), combi aircraft, military airlifter, and VIP transport. Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the A300-600ST Beluga, a oversize cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities. The A300 was the basis for, and retained a high level of commonality with, the second airliner produced by Airbus, the smaller Airbus A310.\n\nOn 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for Air France. Immediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product \u2013 notably Air France and Lufthansa, the first two airlines to place orders for the type. Following the appointment of Bernard Lathi\u00e8re as Henri Ziegler's replacement, an aggressive sales approach was adopted. Indian Airlines was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300, ordering three aircraft with three options. However, between December 1975 and May 1977, there were no sales for the type. During this period a number of \"whitetail\" A300s \u2013 completed but unsold aircraft \u2013 were completed and stored at Toulouse, and production fell to half an aircraft per month amid calls to pause production completely. During the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with Korean Air on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. In September 1974, Korean Air placed an order for 4 A300B4s with options for 2 further aircraft; this sale was viewed as significant as it was the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus had viewed South-East Asia as a vital market that was ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'. It was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result, they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80. The savior of the A300 was the advent of Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS), a revised FAA rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner. In 1977, US carrier Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s as an in-service trial. Frank Borman, ex-astronaut and the then CEO of the airline, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel, even more economical than expected, in contrast to his fleet of Tristars and proceeded to order 23 A300s, becoming the first U.S. customer for the type. This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Aviation author John Bowen alleged that various concessions, such as loan guarantees from European governments and compensation payments, were a factor in the decision as well. The Eastern Air Lines breakthrough was shortly followed by an order from Pan Am. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft. In December 1977, AeroC\u00f3ndor Colombia became the first Airbus operator in Latin America, leasing one Airbus A300, named \"Ciudad de Barranquilla\". During the late 1970s, Airbus adopted a so-called 'Silk Road' strategy, targeting airlines in the Far East. As a result, The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by Japan Air System, Korean Air, China Eastern Airlines, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, China Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Indian Airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA 60-minutes rule for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. In 1977, the A300B4 became the first ETOPS compliant aircraft \u2013 its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 Garuda Indonesia became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new Boeing 767. In 1989, Chinese operator China Eastern Airlines received its first A300; by 2006, the airline operated around 18 A300s, making it the largest operator of both the A300 and the A310 at that time. On 31 May 2014, China Eastern officially retired the last A300-600 in its fleet, having begun drawing down the type in 2010. From 1997 to 2014, a single A300, designated A300 Zero-G, was operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a reduced-gravity aircraft for conducting research into microgravity; the A300 is the largest aircraft to ever have been used in this capacity. A typical flight would last for two and a half hours, enabling up to 30 parabolas to be performed per flight. By the 1990s, the A300 was being heavily promoted as a cargo freighter. The largest freight operator of the A300 is FedEx Express, which has 68 A300 aircraft in service. UPS Airlines also operates 52 freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute ETOPS. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters; large numbers were being converted during the late 1990s. The freighter versions \u2013 either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s \u2013 account for most of the world freighter fleet after the Boeing 747 freighter. The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched (A330 and A340), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives (A300-600ST Beluga Super Transporter). In March 2006, Airbus announced the impending closure of the A300/A310 final assembly line, making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300, an A300F freighter, performed its initial flight on 18 April 2007, and was delivered to FedEx Express on 12 July 2007. Airbus has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025. The useful life of the UPS fleet of 52 delivered from 2000 to 2006 will be extended to 2035 by a flight deck upgrade based around Honeywell Primus Epic avionics : new displays and flight management system (FMS), improved 3-D weather radar, a central maintenance system, and a new version of the current enhanced ground proximity warning system. With a light usage of only two to three cycles per day, it will not reach the maximum number of cycles by then. The first modification will be made at Airbus Toulouse in 2019 and certified in 2020. As of July 2017, there are 211 A300's in service with 22 operators, with the largest operator being FedEx Express with 68 A300-600F aircraft.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A300B1 - Three.\nMain deck in A300B1 - 281 (2-4-2 Y @ 34in)309 (2-4-2 Y @ 31in)max 345.\nLower deck in A300B1 - 20 LD3 + bulk.\nLength in A300B1 - 53.61 m (175.9 ft).\nOverall height in A300B1 - 16.72 m (54.9 ft).\nWingspan in A300B1 - 44.83 m (147.1 ft).\nWing area in A300B1 - 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft).\nMax cabin width in A300B1 - 5.287 m (17.35 ft).\nFuselage diameter in A300B1 - 5.64 m (18.5 ft).\nPressurized Volume in A300B1 - 542 m\u00b3 / 19 140 cu ft.\nMTOW in A300B1 - 165,000 kg (363,763 lb).\nMLW in A300B1 - 136,000 kg (299,829 lb).\nMZFW in A300B1 - 126,000 kg (277,782 lb).\nMax Payload in A300B1 - 37,495 kg (82,662 lb).\nMaximum fuel capacity (d=0.785) in A300B1 - 48,470 kg (106,858 lb)   62,000 L (16,000 US gal)).\nOperating empty weight typical in A300B1 - 88,505 kg (195,120 lb).\nEngines in A300B1 - CF6-50C2 or JT9D-59A.\nTakeoff thrust in A300B1 - 230.15\u2013230.5 kN (51,740\u201351,820 lbf).\nTakeoff field length (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A300B1 - 2,300 m (7,500 ft).\nCruise speed in A300B1 - Mach 0.78 (450 kn; 833 km/h; 518 mph) at FL350.\nRange in A300B1 - 5,375 km / 2,900 nm.\nCockpit crew in A300 - Three.\nMain deck in A300 - 281 (2-4-2 Y @ 34in)309 (2-4-2 Y @ 31in)max 345.\nLower deck in A300 - 20 LD3 + bulk.\nLength in A300 - 53.61 m (175.9 ft).\nOverall height in A300 - 16.72 m (54.9 ft).\nWingspan in A300 - 44.83 m (147.1 ft).\nWing area in A300 - 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft).\nMax cabin width in A300 - 5.287 m (17.35 ft).\nFuselage diameter in A300 - 5.64 m (18.5 ft).\nPressurized Volume in A300 - 542 m\u00b3 / 19 140 cu ft.\nMTOW in A300 - 165,000 kg (363,763 lb).\nMLW in A300 - 136,000 kg (299,829 lb).\nMZFW in A300 - 126,000 kg (277,782 lb).\nMax Payload in A300 - 37,495 kg (82,662 lb).\nMaximum fuel capacity (d=0.785) in A300 - 48,470 kg (106,858 lb)   62,000 L (16,000 US gal)).\nOperating empty weight typical in A300 - 88,505 kg (195,120 lb).\nEngines in A300 - CF6-50C2 or JT9D-59A.\nTakeoff thrust in A300 - 230.15\u2013230.5 kN (51,740\u201351,820 lbf).\nTakeoff field length (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A300 - 2,300 m (7,500 ft).\nCruise speed in A300 - Mach 0.78 (450 kn; 833 km/h; 518 mph) at FL350.\nRange in A300 - 5,375 km / 2,900 nm."}, {"title": "A300B2(A300).txt", "text": "A300B2 ( A330 ):\nThe first production version.

Formally announced in 1969 and first flying in October 1972, it holds the distinction of being the world's first twin-engined widebody airliner; it was also the first product of Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, now known as Airbus. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum range of 4,070 nautical miles (7,540 km) when fully loaded, depending on model. Development of the A300 began during the 1960s as a European collaborative project between various aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. In September 1967, the participating nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to manufacture the aircraft. The British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. A new agreement was reached between Germany and France on 29 May 1969, and Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce the A300. The type first flew on 28 October 1972. Air France, the launch customer for the A300, introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Following a period of limited customer demand, the A300 achieved several large sales in 1978, after which the type was viewed to have proven itself and orders came in at a steady rate across the next three decades. During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with various freight operators, and several different cargo aircraft variants were produced. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller A310 derivative. The freighter sales for which the A300 had previously competed in later life are instead fulfilled by the A330-200F, a derivative of the newer Airbus A330.\n\nDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, based in the UK, and Sud Aviation of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine of the Hawker Siddeley Trident and an expanded development of the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven designated the BAC Two-Eleven, it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch quite similar aircraft onto the market at the same time, none of them would achieve the volume sales needed to make them viable. In 1965, a British government study, known as the Plowden Report, had found British aircraft production costs to be between 10 and 20 per cent higher than American counterparts due to shorter production runs, which in turn was due to the fractured European market. To overcome this factor, the report recommended the pursuit of multinational collaborative projects between the region's leading aircraft manufacturers. European manufacturers were keen to explore prospective programs; the proposed 260-seat wide-body HBN 100 between Hawker Siddeley, Nord Aviation, and Breguet Aviation being one such example. National governments were also keen to support such efforts amid a belief that American manufacturers could dominate the European Economic Community; in particular, Germany had ambitions for a multinational airliner project to invigorate its aircraft industry, which had declined considerably following the Second World War. During the mid-1960s, both Air France and American Airlines had expressed interest in a short-haul twin-engine wide-body aircraft, indicating a market demand for such an aircraft to be produced. In July 1967, during a high-profile meeting between French, German, and British ministers, an agreement was made for greater cooperation between European nations in the field of aviation technology, and \"for the joint development and production of an airbus\". The word airbus at this point was a generic aviation term for a larger commercial aircraft, and was considered acceptable in multiple languages, including French. Shortly after the July 1967 meeting, French engineer Roger B\u00e9teille was appointed as the technical director of what would become the A300 program, while Henri Ziegler, chief operating office of Sud Aviation, was appointed as the general manager of the organization and German politician Franz Josef Strauss became the chairman of the supervisory board. B\u00e9teille drew up an initial work share plan for the project, under which French firms would produce the aircraft's cockpit, the control systems, and lower-center portion of the fuselage, Hawker Siddeley would manufacture the wings, while German companies would produce the forward, rear and upper part of the center fuselage sections. Addition work included moving elements of the wings being produced in the Netherlands, and Spain producing the horizontal tail plane. An early design goal for the A300 that B\u00e9teille had stressed the importance of was the incorporation of a high level of technology, which would serve as a decisive advantage over prospective competitors. As such, the A300 would feature the first use of composite materials of any passenger aircraft, the leading and trailing edges of the tail fin being composed of glass fibre reinforced plastic. B\u00e9teille opted for English as the working language for the developing aircraft, as well against using Metric instrumentation and measurements, as most airlines already had US-built aircraft. These decisions were partially influenced by feedback from various airlines, such as Air France and Lufthansa, as an emphasis had been placed on determining the specifics of what kind of aircraft that potential operators were seeking. According to Airbus, this cultural approach to market research had been crucial to the company's long term success. On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. At this point, the A300 was only the second major joint aircraft programme in Europe, the first being the Anglo-French Concorde. Under the terms of the memorandum, Britain and France were each to receive a 37.5 per cent work share on the project, while Germany received a 25 per cent share. Sud Aviation was recognized as the lead company for A300, with Hawker Siddeley being selected as the British partner company. At the time, the news of the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back BAC's proposed competitor, the BAC 2-11, despite a preference for the latter expressed by British European Airways (BEA). Another parameter was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by Rolls-Royce to power the proposed airliner; a derivative of the in-development Rolls-Royce RB211, the triple-spool RB207, capable of producing of 47,500 lbf. In December 1968, the French and British partner companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. It had been feared that the original 300-seat proposal was too large for the market, thus it had been scaled down to produce the A250. The dimensional changes involved in the shrink reduced the length of the fuselage by 5.62 meters and the diameter by 0.8 meters, reducing the overall weight by 25 tonnes. For increased flexibility, the cabin floor was raised so that standard LD3 freight containers could be accommodated side-by-side, allowing more cargo to be carried. Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft. It was later renamed the A300B. Perhaps the most significant change of the A300B was that it would not require new engines to be developed, being of a suitable size to be powered by Rolls-Royce's RB211, or alternatively the American Pratt & Whitney JT9D and General Electric CF6 powerplants; this switch was recognized as considerably reducing the project's development costs. To attract potential customers in the US market, it was decided that General Electric CF6-50 engines would power the A300 in place of the British RB207; these engines would be produced in co-operation with French firm Snecma. By this time, Rolls-Royce had been concentrating their efforts upon developing their RB211 turbofan engine instead and progress on the RB207's development had been slow for some time, the firm having suffered due to funding limitations, both of which had been factors in the engine switch decision. On 10 April 1969, a few months after the decision to drop the RB207 had been announced, the British government announced that they would withdraw from the Airbus venture. In response, West Germany proposed to France that they would be willing to contribute up to 50% of the project's costs if France was prepared to do the same. Additionally, the managing director of Hawker Siddeley, Sir Arnold Alexander Hall, decided that his company would remain in the project as a favoured sub-contractor, developing and manufacturing the wings for the A300, which would later become pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights. Hawker Siddeley spent \u00a335 million of its own funds, along with a further \u00a335 million loan from the West German government, on the machine tooling to design and produce the wings.\n\nOn 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner. The intention of the project was to produce an aircraft that was smaller, lighter, and more economical than its three-engine American rivals, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. In order to meet Air France's demands for an aircraft larger than 250-seat A300B, it was decided to stretch the fuselage to create a new variant, designated as the A300B2, which would be offered alongside the original 250-seat A300B, henceforth referred to as the A300B1. On 3 September 1970, Air France signed a letter of intent for six A300s, marking the first order to be won for the new airliner. In the aftermath of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities. On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between A\u00e9rospatiale (the newly merged Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation) of France and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company. In 1971, the consortium was joined by a third full partner, the Spanish firm CASA, who received a 4.2 per cent stake, the other two members reducing their stakes to 47.9 per cent each. In 1979, Britain joined the Airbus consortium via British Aerospace, which Hawker Siddeley had merged into, which acquired a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie with France and Germany each reducing their stakes to 37.9 per cent. Airbus Industrie was initially headquartered in Paris, which is where design, development, flight testing, sales, marketing, and customer support activities were centered; the headquarters was relocated to Toulouse in January 1974. The final assembly line for the A300 was located adjacent to Toulouse Blagnac International Airport. The manufacturing process necessitated transporting each aircraft section being produced by the partner companies scattered across Europe to this one location. The combined use of ferries and roads were used for the assembly of the first A300, however this was time-consuming and not viewed as ideal by Felix Kracht, Airbus Industrie's production director. Kracht's solution was to have the various A300 sections brought to Toulouse by a fleet of Boeing 377-derived Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft, by which means none of the manufacturing sites were more than two hours away. Having the sections airlifted in this manner made the A300 the first airliner to use just-in-time manufacturing techniques, and allowed each company to manufacture its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies. In September 1969, construction of the first prototype A300 began. On 28 September 1972, this first prototype was unveiled to the public, it conducted its maiden flight from Toulouse\u2013Blagnac International Airport on 28 October that year. This maiden flight, which was performed a month ahead of schedule, lasted for one hour and 25 minutes; the captain was Max Fischl and the first officer was Bernard Ziegler, son of Henri Ziegler. On 5 February 1973, the second prototype performed its maiden flight. The flight test program, which involved a total of four aircraft, was relatively problem-free, accumulating 1,580 flight hours throughout. In September 1973, as part of promotional efforts for the A300, the new aircraft was taken on a six-week tour around North America and South America, to demonstrate it to airline executives, pilots, and would-be customers. Amongst the consequences of this expedition, it had allegedly brought the A300 to the attention of Frank Borman of Eastern Airlines, one of the \"big four\" U.S. airlines. On 15 March 1974, type certificates were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service. On 23 May 1974, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification was received. The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974, followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially, the success of the consortium was poor, in part due to the economic consequences of the 1973 oil crisis, but by 1979 there were 81 A300 passenger liners in service with 14 airlines, alongside 133 firm orders and 88 options. Ten years after the official launch of the A300, the company had achieved a 26 per cent market share in terms of dollar value, enabling Airbus Industries to proceed with the development of its second aircraft, the Airbus A310. It was the launch of the Airbus A320 in 1987 that firmly established Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market \u2013 over 400 orders were placed before the narrow-body airliner had flown its first flight, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.\n\nThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body medium-to-long range airliner; it has the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. In 1977, the A300 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft, due to its high performance and safety standards. Another world-first of the A300 is the use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft, which was used on both secondary and later primary airframe structures, decreasing overall weight and improving cost-effectiveness. Other firsts included the pioneering use of center-of-gravity control, achieved by transferring fuel between various locations across the aircraft, and electrically signaled secondary flight controls. The A300 is powered by a pair of underwing turbofan engines, either General Electric CF6 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines; the sole use of underwing engine pods allowed for any suitable turbofan engine to be more readily used. The lack of a third tail-mounted engine, as per the trijet configuration used by some competing airliners, allowed for the wings to be located further forwards and to reduce the size of the vertical stabilizer and elevator, which had the effect of increasing the aircraft's flight performance and fuel efficiency. Airbus partners had employed the latest technology, some of which having been derived from Concorde, on the A300. According to Airbus, new technologies adopted for the airliner were selected principally for increased safety, operational capability, and profitability. Upon entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane, which went on to influence later airliner designs. The technological highlights include: \nAdvanced wings by de Havilland (later BAE Systems) with:\n- Supercritical airfoil section for economical performance\n- advanced aerodynamically efficient flight control surfaces\n- 5.64 m (222 in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 LD3 cargo containers side-by-side\n- Structures made from metal billets, reducing weight\n- First airliner to be fitted with wind shear protection\n- Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing\n- Electrically controlled braking system\nLater A300s incorporated other advanced features such as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which enabled a two-pilot flight crew to fly the aircraft alone without the need for a flight engineer, the functions of which were automated; this two-man cockpit concept was a world-first for a wide-body aircraft. Glass cockpit flight instrumentation, which used cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors to display flight, navigation, and warning information, along with fully digital dual autopilots and digital flight control computers for controlling the spoilers, flaps, and leading-edge slats, were also adopted upon later-built models. Additional composites were also made use of, such as carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), as well as their presence in an increasing proportion of the aircraft's components, including the spoilers, rudder, air brakes, and landing gear doors. Another feature of later aircraft were the addition of wingtip fences, which generated greater aerodynamic performance (first introduced on the A310-300). In addition to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, it is the best selling freight aircraft of all time. Various variants of the A300 were built to meet customer demands, often for diverse roles such as aerial refueling tankers, freighter models (new-build and conversions), combi aircraft, military airlifter, and VIP transport. Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the A300-600ST Beluga, a oversize cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities. The A300 was the basis for, and retained a high level of commonality with, the second airliner produced by Airbus, the smaller Airbus A310.\n\nOn 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for Air France. Immediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product \u2013 notably Air France and Lufthansa, the first two airlines to place orders for the type. Following the appointment of Bernard Lathi\u00e8re as Henri Ziegler's replacement, an aggressive sales approach was adopted. Indian Airlines was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300, ordering three aircraft with three options. However, between December 1975 and May 1977, there were no sales for the type. During this period a number of \"whitetail\" A300s \u2013 completed but unsold aircraft \u2013 were completed and stored at Toulouse, and production fell to half an aircraft per month amid calls to pause production completely. During the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with Korean Air on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. In September 1974, Korean Air placed an order for 4 A300B4s with options for 2 further aircraft; this sale was viewed as significant as it was the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus had viewed South-East Asia as a vital market that was ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'. It was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result, they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80. The savior of the A300 was the advent of Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS), a revised FAA rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner. In 1977, US carrier Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s as an in-service trial. Frank Borman, ex-astronaut and the then CEO of the airline, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel, even more economical than expected, in contrast to his fleet of Tristars and proceeded to order 23 A300s, becoming the first U.S. customer for the type. This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Aviation author John Bowen alleged that various concessions, such as loan guarantees from European governments and compensation payments, were a factor in the decision as well. The Eastern Air Lines breakthrough was shortly followed by an order from Pan Am. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft. In December 1977, AeroC\u00f3ndor Colombia became the first Airbus operator in Latin America, leasing one Airbus A300, named \"Ciudad de Barranquilla\". During the late 1970s, Airbus adopted a so-called 'Silk Road' strategy, targeting airlines in the Far East. As a result, The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by Japan Air System, Korean Air, China Eastern Airlines, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, China Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Indian Airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA 60-minutes rule for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. In 1977, the A300B4 became the first ETOPS compliant aircraft \u2013 its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 Garuda Indonesia became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new Boeing 767. In 1989, Chinese operator China Eastern Airlines received its first A300; by 2006, the airline operated around 18 A300s, making it the largest operator of both the A300 and the A310 at that time. On 31 May 2014, China Eastern officially retired the last A300-600 in its fleet, having begun drawing down the type in 2010. From 1997 to 2014, a single A300, designated A300 Zero-G, was operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a reduced-gravity aircraft for conducting research into microgravity; the A300 is the largest aircraft to ever have been used in this capacity. A typical flight would last for two and a half hours, enabling up to 30 parabolas to be performed per flight. By the 1990s, the A300 was being heavily promoted as a cargo freighter. The largest freight operator of the A300 is FedEx Express, which has 68 A300 aircraft in service. UPS Airlines also operates 52 freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute ETOPS. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters; large numbers were being converted during the late 1990s. The freighter versions \u2013 either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s \u2013 account for most of the world freighter fleet after the Boeing 747 freighter. The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched (A330 and A340), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives (A300-600ST Beluga Super Transporter). In March 2006, Airbus announced the impending closure of the A300/A310 final assembly line, making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300, an A300F freighter, performed its initial flight on 18 April 2007, and was delivered to FedEx Express on 12 July 2007. Airbus has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025. The useful life of the UPS fleet of 52 delivered from 2000 to 2006 will be extended to 2035 by a flight deck upgrade based around Honeywell Primus Epic avionics : new displays and flight management system (FMS), improved 3-D weather radar, a central maintenance system, and a new version of the current enhanced ground proximity warning system. With a light usage of only two to three cycles per day, it will not reach the maximum number of cycles by then. The first modification will be made at Airbus Toulouse in 2019 and certified in 2020. As of July 2017, there are 211 A300's in service with 22 operators, with the largest operator being FedEx Express with 68 A300-600F aircraft.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A300 - Three.\nMain deck in A300 - 281 (2-4-2 Y @ 34in)309 (2-4-2 Y @ 31in)max 345.\nLower deck in A300 - 20 LD3 + bulk.\nLength in A300 - 53.61 m (175.9 ft).\nOverall height in A300 - 16.72 m (54.9 ft).\nWingspan in A300 - 44.83 m (147.1 ft).\nWing area in A300 - 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft).\nMax cabin width in A300 - 5.287 m (17.35 ft).\nFuselage diameter in A300 - 5.64 m (18.5 ft).\nPressurized Volume in A300 - 542 m\u00b3 / 19 140 cu ft.\nMTOW in A300 - 165,000 kg (363,763 lb).\nMLW in A300 - 136,000 kg (299,829 lb).\nMZFW in A300 - 126,000 kg (277,782 lb).\nMax Payload in A300 - 37,495 kg (82,662 lb).\nMaximum fuel capacity (d=0.785) in A300 - 48,470 kg (106,858 lb)   62,000 L (16,000 US gal)).\nOperating empty weight typical in A300 - 88,505 kg (195,120 lb).\nEngines in A300 - CF6-50C2 or JT9D-59A.\nTakeoff thrust in A300 - 230.15\u2013230.5 kN (51,740\u201351,820 lbf).\nTakeoff field length (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A300 - 2,300 m (7,500 ft).\nCruise speed in A300 - Mach 0.78 (450 kn; 833 km/h; 518 mph) at FL350.\nRange in A300 - 5,375 km / 2,900 nm.\nCockpit crew in A300B2 - Three.\nMain deck in A300B2 - 281 (2-4-2 Y @ 34in)309 (2-4-2 Y @ 31in)max 345.\nLower deck in A300B2 - 20 LD3 + bulk.\nLength in A300B2 - 53.61 m (175.9 ft).\nOverall height in A300B2 - 16.72 m (54.9 ft).\nWingspan in A300B2 - 44.83 m (147.1 ft).\nWing area in A300B2 - 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft).\nMax cabin width in A300B2 - 5.287 m (17.35 ft).\nFuselage diameter in A300B2 - 5.64 m (18.5 ft).\nPressurized Volume in A300B2 - 542 m\u00b3 / 19 140 cu ft.\nMTOW in A300B2 - 165,000 kg (363,763 lb).\nMLW in A300B2 - 136,000 kg (299,829 lb).\nMZFW in A300B2 - 126,000 kg (277,782 lb).\nMax Payload in A300B2 - 37,495 kg (82,662 lb).\nMaximum fuel capacity (d=0.785) in A300B2 - 48,470 kg (106,858 lb)   62,000 L (16,000 US gal)).\nOperating empty weight typical in A300B2 - 88,505 kg (195,120 lb).\nEngines in A300B2 - CF6-50C2 or JT9D-59A.\nTakeoff thrust in A300B2 - 230.15\u2013230.5 kN (51,740\u201351,820 lbf).\nTakeoff field length (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A300B2 - 2,300 m (7,500 ft).\nCruise speed in A300B2 - Mach 0.78 (450 kn; 833 km/h; 518 mph) at FL350.\nRange in A300B2 - 5,375 km / 2,900 nm."}, {"title": "A300B4(A300).txt", "text": "A300B4 ( A300 ):\n\nThe major production version features a centre fuel tank for increased fuel capacity (47,500 kg) and new wing root Kr\u00fcger flaps which were later made available as an option for the A300B2.

Formally announced in 1969 and first flying in October 1972, it holds the distinction of being the world's first twin-engined widebody airliner; it was also the first product of Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, now known as Airbus. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum range of 4,070 nautical miles (7,540 km) when fully loaded, depending on model. Development of the A300 began during the 1960s as a European collaborative project between various aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. In September 1967, the participating nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to manufacture the aircraft. The British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. A new agreement was reached between Germany and France on 29 May 1969, and Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce the A300. The type first flew on 28 October 1972. Air France, the launch customer for the A300, introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Following a period of limited customer demand, the A300 achieved several large sales in 1978, after which the type was viewed to have proven itself and orders came in at a steady rate across the next three decades. During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with various freight operators, and several different cargo aircraft variants were produced. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller A310 derivative. The freighter sales for which the A300 had previously competed in later life are instead fulfilled by the A330-200F, a derivative of the newer Airbus A330.\n\nDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, based in the UK, and Sud Aviation of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine of the Hawker Siddeley Trident and an expanded development of the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven designated the BAC Two-Eleven, it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch quite similar aircraft onto the market at the same time, none of them would achieve the volume sales needed to make them viable. In 1965, a British government study, known as the Plowden Report, had found British aircraft production costs to be between 10 and 20 per cent higher than American counterparts due to shorter production runs, which in turn was due to the fractured European market. To overcome this factor, the report recommended the pursuit of multinational collaborative projects between the region's leading aircraft manufacturers. European manufacturers were keen to explore prospective programs; the proposed 260-seat wide-body HBN 100 between Hawker Siddeley, Nord Aviation, and Breguet Aviation being one such example. National governments were also keen to support such efforts amid a belief that American manufacturers could dominate the European Economic Community; in particular, Germany had ambitions for a multinational airliner project to invigorate its aircraft industry, which had declined considerably following the Second World War. During the mid-1960s, both Air France and American Airlines had expressed interest in a short-haul twin-engine wide-body aircraft, indicating a market demand for such an aircraft to be produced. In July 1967, during a high-profile meeting between French, German, and British ministers, an agreement was made for greater cooperation between European nations in the field of aviation technology, and \"for the joint development and production of an airbus\". The word airbus at this point was a generic aviation term for a larger commercial aircraft, and was considered acceptable in multiple languages, including French. Shortly after the July 1967 meeting, French engineer Roger B\u00e9teille was appointed as the technical director of what would become the A300 program, while Henri Ziegler, chief operating office of Sud Aviation, was appointed as the general manager of the organization and German politician Franz Josef Strauss became the chairman of the supervisory board. B\u00e9teille drew up an initial work share plan for the project, under which French firms would produce the aircraft's cockpit, the control systems, and lower-center portion of the fuselage, Hawker Siddeley would manufacture the wings, while German companies would produce the forward, rear and upper part of the center fuselage sections. Addition work included moving elements of the wings being produced in the Netherlands, and Spain producing the horizontal tail plane. An early design goal for the A300 that B\u00e9teille had stressed the importance of was the incorporation of a high level of technology, which would serve as a decisive advantage over prospective competitors. As such, the A300 would feature the first use of composite materials of any passenger aircraft, the leading and trailing edges of the tail fin being composed of glass fibre reinforced plastic. B\u00e9teille opted for English as the working language for the developing aircraft, as well against using Metric instrumentation and measurements, as most airlines already had US-built aircraft. These decisions were partially influenced by feedback from various airlines, such as Air France and Lufthansa, as an emphasis had been placed on determining the specifics of what kind of aircraft that potential operators were seeking. According to Airbus, this cultural approach to market research had been crucial to the company's long term success. On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. At this point, the A300 was only the second major joint aircraft programme in Europe, the first being the Anglo-French Concorde. Under the terms of the memorandum, Britain and France were each to receive a 37.5 per cent work share on the project, while Germany received a 25 per cent share. Sud Aviation was recognized as the lead company for A300, with Hawker Siddeley being selected as the British partner company. At the time, the news of the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back BAC's proposed competitor, the BAC 2-11, despite a preference for the latter expressed by British European Airways (BEA). Another parameter was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by Rolls-Royce to power the proposed airliner; a derivative of the in-development Rolls-Royce RB211, the triple-spool RB207, capable of producing of 47,500 lbf. In December 1968, the French and British partner companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. It had been feared that the original 300-seat proposal was too large for the market, thus it had been scaled down to produce the A250. The dimensional changes involved in the shrink reduced the length of the fuselage by 5.62 meters and the diameter by 0.8 meters, reducing the overall weight by 25 tonnes. For increased flexibility, the cabin floor was raised so that standard LD3 freight containers could be accommodated side-by-side, allowing more cargo to be carried. Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft. It was later renamed the A300B. Perhaps the most significant change of the A300B was that it would not require new engines to be developed, being of a suitable size to be powered by Rolls-Royce's RB211, or alternatively the American Pratt & Whitney JT9D and General Electric CF6 powerplants; this switch was recognized as considerably reducing the project's development costs. To attract potential customers in the US market, it was decided that General Electric CF6-50 engines would power the A300 in place of the British RB207; these engines would be produced in co-operation with French firm Snecma. By this time, Rolls-Royce had been concentrating their efforts upon developing their RB211 turbofan engine instead and progress on the RB207's development had been slow for some time, the firm having suffered due to funding limitations, both of which had been factors in the engine switch decision. On 10 April 1969, a few months after the decision to drop the RB207 had been announced, the British government announced that they would withdraw from the Airbus venture. In response, West Germany proposed to France that they would be willing to contribute up to 50% of the project's costs if France was prepared to do the same. Additionally, the managing director of Hawker Siddeley, Sir Arnold Alexander Hall, decided that his company would remain in the project as a favoured sub-contractor, developing and manufacturing the wings for the A300, which would later become pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights. Hawker Siddeley spent \u00a335 million of its own funds, along with a further \u00a335 million loan from the West German government, on the machine tooling to design and produce the wings.\n\nOn 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner. The intention of the project was to produce an aircraft that was smaller, lighter, and more economical than its three-engine American rivals, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. In order to meet Air France's demands for an aircraft larger than 250-seat A300B, it was decided to stretch the fuselage to create a new variant, designated as the A300B2, which would be offered alongside the original 250-seat A300B, henceforth referred to as the A300B1. On 3 September 1970, Air France signed a letter of intent for six A300s, marking the first order to be won for the new airliner. In the aftermath of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities. On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between A\u00e9rospatiale (the newly merged Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation) of France and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company. In 1971, the consortium was joined by a third full partner, the Spanish firm CASA, who received a 4.2 per cent stake, the other two members reducing their stakes to 47.9 per cent each. In 1979, Britain joined the Airbus consortium via British Aerospace, which Hawker Siddeley had merged into, which acquired a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie with France and Germany each reducing their stakes to 37.9 per cent. Airbus Industrie was initially headquartered in Paris, which is where design, development, flight testing, sales, marketing, and customer support activities were centered; the headquarters was relocated to Toulouse in January 1974. The final assembly line for the A300 was located adjacent to Toulouse Blagnac International Airport. The manufacturing process necessitated transporting each aircraft section being produced by the partner companies scattered across Europe to this one location. The combined use of ferries and roads were used for the assembly of the first A300, however this was time-consuming and not viewed as ideal by Felix Kracht, Airbus Industrie's production director. Kracht's solution was to have the various A300 sections brought to Toulouse by a fleet of Boeing 377-derived Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft, by which means none of the manufacturing sites were more than two hours away. Having the sections airlifted in this manner made the A300 the first airliner to use just-in-time manufacturing techniques, and allowed each company to manufacture its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies. In September 1969, construction of the first prototype A300 began. On 28 September 1972, this first prototype was unveiled to the public, it conducted its maiden flight from Toulouse\u2013Blagnac International Airport on 28 October that year. This maiden flight, which was performed a month ahead of schedule, lasted for one hour and 25 minutes; the captain was Max Fischl and the first officer was Bernard Ziegler, son of Henri Ziegler. On 5 February 1973, the second prototype performed its maiden flight. The flight test program, which involved a total of four aircraft, was relatively problem-free, accumulating 1,580 flight hours throughout. In September 1973, as part of promotional efforts for the A300, the new aircraft was taken on a six-week tour around North America and South America, to demonstrate it to airline executives, pilots, and would-be customers. Amongst the consequences of this expedition, it had allegedly brought the A300 to the attention of Frank Borman of Eastern Airlines, one of the \"big four\" U.S. airlines. On 15 March 1974, type certificates were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service. On 23 May 1974, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification was received. The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974, followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially, the success of the consortium was poor, in part due to the economic consequences of the 1973 oil crisis, but by 1979 there were 81 A300 passenger liners in service with 14 airlines, alongside 133 firm orders and 88 options. Ten years after the official launch of the A300, the company had achieved a 26 per cent market share in terms of dollar value, enabling Airbus Industries to proceed with the development of its second aircraft, the Airbus A310. It was the launch of the Airbus A320 in 1987 that firmly established Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market \u2013 over 400 orders were placed before the narrow-body airliner had flown its first flight, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.\n\nThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body medium-to-long range airliner; it has the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. In 1977, the A300 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft, due to its high performance and safety standards. Another world-first of the A300 is the use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft, which was used on both secondary and later primary airframe structures, decreasing overall weight and improving cost-effectiveness. Other firsts included the pioneering use of center-of-gravity control, achieved by transferring fuel between various locations across the aircraft, and electrically signaled secondary flight controls. The A300 is powered by a pair of underwing turbofan engines, either General Electric CF6 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines; the sole use of underwing engine pods allowed for any suitable turbofan engine to be more readily used. The lack of a third tail-mounted engine, as per the trijet configuration used by some competing airliners, allowed for the wings to be located further forwards and to reduce the size of the vertical stabilizer and elevator, which had the effect of increasing the aircraft's flight performance and fuel efficiency. Airbus partners had employed the latest technology, some of which having been derived from Concorde, on the A300. According to Airbus, new technologies adopted for the airliner were selected principally for increased safety, operational capability, and profitability. Upon entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane, which went on to influence later airliner designs. The technological highlights include: \nAdvanced wings by de Havilland (later BAE Systems) with:\n- Supercritical airfoil section for economical performance\n- advanced aerodynamically efficient flight control surfaces\n- 5.64 m (222 in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 LD3 cargo containers side-by-side\n- Structures made from metal billets, reducing weight\n- First airliner to be fitted with wind shear protection\n- Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing\n- Electrically controlled braking system\nLater A300s incorporated other advanced features such as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which enabled a two-pilot flight crew to fly the aircraft alone without the need for a flight engineer, the functions of which were automated; this two-man cockpit concept was a world-first for a wide-body aircraft. Glass cockpit flight instrumentation, which used cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors to display flight, navigation, and warning information, along with fully digital dual autopilots and digital flight control computers for controlling the spoilers, flaps, and leading-edge slats, were also adopted upon later-built models. Additional composites were also made use of, such as carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), as well as their presence in an increasing proportion of the aircraft's components, including the spoilers, rudder, air brakes, and landing gear doors. Another feature of later aircraft were the addition of wingtip fences, which generated greater aerodynamic performance (first introduced on the A310-300). In addition to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, it is the best selling freight aircraft of all time. Various variants of the A300 were built to meet customer demands, often for diverse roles such as aerial refueling tankers, freighter models (new-build and conversions), combi aircraft, military airlifter, and VIP transport. Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the A300-600ST Beluga, a oversize cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities. The A300 was the basis for, and retained a high level of commonality with, the second airliner produced by Airbus, the smaller Airbus A310.\n\nOn 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for Air France. Immediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product \u2013 notably Air France and Lufthansa, the first two airlines to place orders for the type. Following the appointment of Bernard Lathi\u00e8re as Henri Ziegler's replacement, an aggressive sales approach was adopted. Indian Airlines was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300, ordering three aircraft with three options. However, between December 1975 and May 1977, there were no sales for the type. During this period a number of \"whitetail\" A300s \u2013 completed but unsold aircraft \u2013 were completed and stored at Toulouse, and production fell to half an aircraft per month amid calls to pause production completely. During the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with Korean Air on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. In September 1974, Korean Air placed an order for 4 A300B4s with options for 2 further aircraft; this sale was viewed as significant as it was the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus had viewed South-East Asia as a vital market that was ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'. It was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result, they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80. The savior of the A300 was the advent of Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS), a revised FAA rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner. In 1977, US carrier Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s as an in-service trial. Frank Borman, ex-astronaut and the then CEO of the airline, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel, even more economical than expected, in contrast to his fleet of Tristars and proceeded to order 23 A300s, becoming the first U.S. customer for the type. This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Aviation author John Bowen alleged that various concessions, such as loan guarantees from European governments and compensation payments, were a factor in the decision as well. The Eastern Air Lines breakthrough was shortly followed by an order from Pan Am. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft. In December 1977, AeroC\u00f3ndor Colombia became the first Airbus operator in Latin America, leasing one Airbus A300, named \"Ciudad de Barranquilla\". During the late 1970s, Airbus adopted a so-called 'Silk Road' strategy, targeting airlines in the Far East. As a result, The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by Japan Air System, Korean Air, China Eastern Airlines, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, China Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Indian Airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA 60-minutes rule for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. In 1977, the A300B4 became the first ETOPS compliant aircraft \u2013 its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 Garuda Indonesia became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new Boeing 767. In 1989, Chinese operator China Eastern Airlines received its first A300; by 2006, the airline operated around 18 A300s, making it the largest operator of both the A300 and the A310 at that time. On 31 May 2014, China Eastern officially retired the last A300-600 in its fleet, having begun drawing down the type in 2010. From 1997 to 2014, a single A300, designated A300 Zero-G, was operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a reduced-gravity aircraft for conducting research into microgravity; the A300 is the largest aircraft to ever have been used in this capacity. A typical flight would last for two and a half hours, enabling up to 30 parabolas to be performed per flight. By the 1990s, the A300 was being heavily promoted as a cargo freighter. The largest freight operator of the A300 is FedEx Express, which has 68 A300 aircraft in service. UPS Airlines also operates 52 freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute ETOPS. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters; large numbers were being converted during the late 1990s. The freighter versions \u2013 either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s \u2013 account for most of the world freighter fleet after the Boeing 747 freighter. The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched (A330 and A340), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives (A300-600ST Beluga Super Transporter). In March 2006, Airbus announced the impending closure of the A300/A310 final assembly line, making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300, an A300F freighter, performed its initial flight on 18 April 2007, and was delivered to FedEx Express on 12 July 2007. Airbus has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025. The useful life of the UPS fleet of 52 delivered from 2000 to 2006 will be extended to 2035 by a flight deck upgrade based around Honeywell Primus Epic avionics : new displays and flight management system (FMS), improved 3-D weather radar, a central maintenance system, and a new version of the current enhanced ground proximity warning system. With a light usage of only two to three cycles per day, it will not reach the maximum number of cycles by then. The first modification will be made at Airbus Toulouse in 2019 and certified in 2020. As of July 2017, there are 211 A300's in service with 22 operators, with the largest operator being FedEx Express with 68 A300-600F aircraft.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A300B4 - Three.\nMain deck in A300B4 - 281 (2-4-2 Y @ 34in)309 (2-4-2 Y @ 31in)max 345.\nLower deck in A300B4 - 20 LD3 + bulk.\nLength in A300B4 - 53.61 m (175.9 ft).\nOverall height in A300B4 - 16.72 m (54.9 ft).\nWingspan in A300B4 - 44.83 m (147.1 ft).\nWing area in A300B4 - 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft).\nMax cabin width in A300B4 - 5.287 m (17.35 ft).\nFuselage diameter in A300B4 - 5.64 m (18.5 ft).\nPressurized Volume in A300B4 - 542 m\u00b3 / 19 140 cu ft.\nMTOW in A300B4 - 165,000 kg (363,763 lb).\nMLW in A300B4 - 136,000 kg (299,829 lb).\nMZFW in A300B4 - 126,000 kg (277,782 lb).\nMax Payload in A300B4 - 37,495 kg (82,662 lb).\nMaximum fuel capacity (d=0.785) in A300B4 - 48,470 kg (106,858 lb)   62,000 L (16,000 US gal)).\nOperating empty weight typical in A300B4 - 88,505 kg (195,120 lb).\nEngines in A300B4 - CF6-50C2 or JT9D-59A.\nTakeoff thrust in A300B4 - 230.15\u2013230.5 kN (51,740\u201351,820 lbf).\nTakeoff field length (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A300B4 - 2,300 m (7,500 ft).\nCruise speed in A300B4 - Mach 0.78 (450 kn; 833 km/h; 518 mph) at FL350.\nRange in A300B4 - 5,375 km / 2,900 nm.\nCockpit crew in A300 - Three.\nMain deck in A300 - 281 (2-4-2 Y @ 34in)309 (2-4-2 Y @ 31in)max 345.\nLower deck in A300 - 20 LD3 + bulk.\nLength in A300 - 53.61 m (175.9 ft).\nOverall height in A300 - 16.72 m (54.9 ft).\nWingspan in A300 - 44.83 m (147.1 ft).\nWing area in A300 - 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft).\nMax cabin width in A300 - 5.287 m (17.35 ft).\nFuselage diameter in A300 - 5.64 m (18.5 ft).\nPressurized Volume in A300 - 542 m\u00b3 / 19 140 cu ft.\nMTOW in A300 - 165,000 kg (363,763 lb).\nMLW in A300 - 136,000 kg (299,829 lb).\nMZFW in A300 - 126,000 kg (277,782 lb).\nMax Payload in A300 - 37,495 kg (82,662 lb).\nMaximum fuel capacity (d=0.785) in A300 - 48,470 kg (106,858 lb)   62,000 L (16,000 US gal)).\nOperating empty weight typical in A300 - 88,505 kg (195,120 lb).\nEngines in A300 - CF6-50C2 or JT9D-59A.\nTakeoff thrust in A300 - 230.15\u2013230.5 kN (51,740\u201351,820 lbf).\nTakeoff field length (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A300 - 2,300 m (7,500 ft).\nCruise speed in A300 - Mach 0.78 (450 kn; 833 km/h; 518 mph) at FL350.\nRange in A300 - 5,375 km / 2,900 nm."}, {"title": "A300.txt", "text": "A300:\n\nThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and manufactured by Airbus. Formally announced in 1969 and first flying in October 1972, it holds the distinction of being the world's first twin-engined widebody airliner; it was also the first product of Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, now known as Airbus. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum range of 4,070 nautical miles (7,540 km) when fully loaded, depending on model. Development of the A300 began during the 1960s as a European collaborative project between various aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. In September 1967, the participating nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to manufacture the aircraft. The British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. A new agreement was reached between Germany and France on 29 May 1969, and Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce the A300. The type first flew on 28 October 1972. Air France, the launch customer for the A300, introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Following a period of limited customer demand, the A300 achieved several large sales in 1978, after which the type was viewed to have proven itself and orders came in at a steady rate across the next three decades. During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with various freight operators, and several different cargo aircraft variants were produced. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller A310 derivative. The freighter sales for which the A300 had previously competed in later life are instead fulfilled by the A330-200F, a derivative of the newer Airbus A330.\t\nDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, based in the UK, and Sud Aviation of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine of the Hawker Siddeley Trident and an expanded development of the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven designated the BAC Two-Eleven, it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch quite similar aircraft onto the market at the same time, none of them would achieve the volume sales needed to make them viable. In 1965, a British government study, known as the Plowden Report, had found British aircraft production costs to be between 10 and 20 per cent higher than American counterparts due to shorter production runs, which in turn was due to the fractured European market. To overcome this factor, the report recommended the pursuit of multinational collaborative projects between the region's leading aircraft manufacturers. European manufacturers were keen to explore prospective programs; the proposed 260-seat wide-body HBN 100 between Hawker Siddeley, Nord Aviation, and Breguet Aviation being one such example. National governments were also keen to support such efforts amid a belief that American manufacturers could dominate the European Economic Community; in particular, Germany had ambitions for a multinational airliner project to invigorate its aircraft industry, which had declined considerably following the Second World War. During the mid-1960s, both Air France and American Airlines had expressed interest in a short-haul twin-engine wide-body aircraft, indicating a market demand for such an aircraft to be produced. In July 1967, during a high-profile meeting between French, German, and British ministers, an agreement was made for greater cooperation between European nations in the field of aviation technology, and \"for the joint development and production of an airbus\". The word airbus at this point was a generic aviation term for a larger commercial aircraft, and was considered acceptable in multiple languages, including French. Shortly after the July 1967 meeting, French engineer Roger B\u00e9teille was appointed as the technical director of what would become the A300 program, while Henri Ziegler, chief operating office of Sud Aviation, was appointed as the general manager of the organization and German politician Franz Josef Strauss became the chairman of the supervisory board. B\u00e9teille drew up an initial work share plan for the project, under which French firms would produce the aircraft's cockpit, the control systems, and lower-center portion of the fuselage, Hawker Siddeley would manufacture the wings, while German companies would produce the forward, rear and upper part of the center fuselage sections. Addition work included moving elements of the wings being produced in the Netherlands, and Spain producing the horizontal tail plane. An early design goal for the A300 that B\u00e9teille had stressed the importance of was the incorporation of a high level of technology, which would serve as a decisive advantage over prospective competitors. As such, the A300 would feature the first use of composite materials of any passenger aircraft, the leading and trailing edges of the tail fin being composed of glass fibre reinforced plastic. B\u00e9teille opted for English as the working language for the developing aircraft, as well against using Metric instrumentation and measurements, as most airlines already had US-built aircraft. These decisions were partially influenced by feedback from various airlines, such as Air France and Lufthansa, as an emphasis had been placed on determining the specifics of what kind of aircraft that potential operators were seeking. According to Airbus, this cultural approach to market research had been crucial to the company's long term success. On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. At this point, the A300 was only the second major joint aircraft programme in Europe, the first being the Anglo-French Concorde. Under the terms of the memorandum, Britain and France were each to receive a 37.5 per cent work share on the project, while Germany received a 25 per cent share. Sud Aviation was recognized as the lead company for A300, with Hawker Siddeley being selected as the British partner company. At the time, the news of the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back BAC's proposed competitor, the BAC 2-11, despite a preference for the latter expressed by British European Airways (BEA). Another parameter was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by Rolls-Royce to power the proposed airliner; a derivative of the in-development Rolls-Royce RB211, the triple-spool RB207, capable of producing of 47,500 lbf. In December 1968, the French and British partner companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. It had been feared that the original 300-seat proposal was too large for the market, thus it had been scaled down to produce the A250. The dimensional changes involved in the shrink reduced the length of the fuselage by 5.62 meters and the diameter by 0.8 meters, reducing the overall weight by 25 tonnes. For increased flexibility, the cabin floor was raised so that standard LD3 freight containers could be accommodated side-by-side, allowing more cargo to be carried. Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft. It was later renamed the A300B. Perhaps the most significant change of the A300B was that it would not require new engines to be developed, being of a suitable size to be powered by Rolls-Royce's RB211, or alternatively the American Pratt & Whitney JT9D and General Electric CF6 powerplants; this switch was recognized as considerably reducing the project's development costs. To attract potential customers in the US market, it was decided that General Electric CF6-50 engines would power the A300 in place of the British RB207; these engines would be produced in co-operation with French firm Snecma. By this time, Rolls-Royce had been concentrating their efforts upon developing their RB211 turbofan engine instead and progress on the RB207's development had been slow for some time, the firm having suffered due to funding limitations, both of which had been factors in the engine switch decision. On 10 April 1969, a few months after the decision to drop the RB207 had been announced, the British government announced that they would withdraw from the Airbus venture. In response, West Germany proposed to France that they would be willing to contribute up to 50% of the project's costs if France was prepared to do the same. Additionally, the managing director of Hawker Siddeley, Sir Arnold Alexander Hall, decided that his company would remain in the project as a favoured sub-contractor, developing and manufacturing the wings for the A300, which would later become pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights. Hawker Siddeley spent \u00a335 million of its own funds, along with a further \u00a335 million loan from the West German government, on the machine tooling to design and produce the wings.\nOn 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner. The intention of the project was to produce an aircraft that was smaller, lighter, and more economical than its three-engine American rivals, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. In order to meet Air France's demands for an aircraft larger than 250-seat A300B, it was decided to stretch the fuselage to create a new variant, designated as the A300B2, which would be offered alongside the original 250-seat A300B, henceforth referred to as the A300B1. On 3 September 1970, Air France signed a letter of intent for six A300s, marking the first order to be won for the new airliner. In the aftermath of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities. On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between A\u00e9rospatiale (the newly merged Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation) of France and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company. In 1971, the consortium was joined by a third full partner, the Spanish firm CASA, who received a 4.2 per cent stake, the other two members reducing their stakes to 47.9 per cent each. In 1979, Britain joined the Airbus consortium via British Aerospace, which Hawker Siddeley had merged into, which acquired a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie with France and Germany each reducing their stakes to 37.9 per cent. Airbus Industrie was initially headquartered in Paris, which is where design, development, flight testing, sales, marketing, and customer support activities were centered; the headquarters was relocated to Toulouse in January 1974. The final assembly line for the A300 was located adjacent to Toulouse Blagnac International Airport. The manufacturing process necessitated transporting each aircraft section being produced by the partner companies scattered across Europe to this one location. The combined use of ferries and roads were used for the assembly of the first A300, however this was time-consuming and not viewed as ideal by Felix Kracht, Airbus Industrie's production director. Kracht's solution was to have the various A300 sections brought to Toulouse by a fleet of Boeing 377-derived Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft, by which means none of the manufacturing sites were more than two hours away. Having the sections airlifted in this manner made the A300 the first airliner to use just-in-time manufacturing techniques, and allowed each company to manufacture its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies. In September 1969, construction of the first prototype A300 began. On 28 September 1972, this first prototype was unveiled to the public, it conducted its maiden flight from Toulouse\u2013Blagnac International Airport on 28 October that year. This maiden flight, which was performed a month ahead of schedule, lasted for one hour and 25 minutes; the captain was Max Fischl and the first officer was Bernard Ziegler, son of Henri Ziegler. On 5 February 1973, the second prototype performed its maiden flight. The flight test program, which involved a total of four aircraft, was relatively problem-free, accumulating 1,580 flight hours throughout. In September 1973, as part of promotional efforts for the A300, the new aircraft was taken on a six-week tour around North America and South America, to demonstrate it to airline executives, pilots, and would-be customers. Amongst the consequences of this expedition, it had allegedly brought the A300 to the attention of Frank Borman of Eastern Airlines, one of the \"big four\" U.S. airlines. On 15 March 1974, type certificates were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service. On 23 May 1974, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification was received. The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974, followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially, the success of the consortium was poor, in part due to the economic consequences of the 1973 oil crisis, but by 1979 there were 81 A300 passenger liners in service with 14 airlines, alongside 133 firm orders and 88 options. Ten years after the official launch of the A300, the company had achieved a 26 per cent market share in terms of dollar value, enabling Airbus Industries to proceed with the development of its second aircraft, the Airbus A310. It was the launch of the Airbus A320 in 1987 that firmly established Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market \u2013 over 400 orders were placed before the narrow-body airliner had flown its first flight, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.\nThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body medium-to-long range airliner; it has the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. In 1977, the A300 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft, due to its high performance and safety standards. Another world-first of the A300 is the use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft, which was used on both secondary and later primary airframe structures, decreasing overall weight and improving cost-effectiveness. Other firsts included the pioneering use of center-of-gravity control, achieved by transferring fuel between various locations across the aircraft, and electrically signaled secondary flight controls. The A300 is powered by a pair of underwing turbofan engines, either General Electric CF6 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines; the sole use of underwing engine pods allowed for any suitable turbofan engine to be more readily used. The lack of a third tail-mounted engine, as per the trijet configuration used by some competing airliners, allowed for the wings to be located further forwards and to reduce the size of the vertical stabilizer and elevator, which had the effect of increasing the aircraft's flight performance and fuel efficiency. Airbus partners had employed the latest technology, some of which having been derived from Concorde, on the A300. According to Airbus, new technologies adopted for the airliner were selected principally for increased safety, operational capability, and profitability. Upon entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane, which went on to influence later airliner designs. The technological highlights include: \nAdvanced wings by de Havilland (later BAE Systems) with:\nSupercritical airfoil section for economical performance\nadvanced aerodynamically efficient flight control surfaces\n5.64 m (222 in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 LD3 cargo containers side-by-side\nStructures made from metal billets, reducing weight\nFirst airliner to be fitted with wind shear protection\nAdvanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing\nElectrically controlled braking system\nLater A300s incorporated other advanced features such as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which enabled a two-pilot flight crew to fly the aircraft alone without the need for a flight engineer, the functions of which were automated; this two-man cockpit concept was a world-first for a wide-body aircraft. Glass cockpit flight instrumentation, which used cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors to display flight, navigation, and warning information, along with fully digital dual autopilots and digital flight control computers for controlling the spoilers, flaps, and leading-edge slats, were also adopted upon later-built models. Additional composites were also made use of, such as carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), as well as their presence in an increasing proportion of the aircraft's components, including the spoilers, rudder, air brakes, and landing gear doors. Another feature of later aircraft were the addition of wingtip fences, which generated greater aerodynamic performance (first introduced on the A310-300). In addition to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, it is the best selling freight aircraft of all time. Various variants of the A300 were built to meet customer demands, often for diverse roles such as aerial refueling tankers, freighter models (new-build and conversions), combi aircraft, military airlifter, and VIP transport. Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the A300-600ST Beluga, a oversize cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities. The A300 was the basis for, and retained a high level of commonality with, the second airliner produced by Airbus, the smaller Airbus A310.\nOn 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for Air France. Immediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product \u2013 notably Air France and Lufthansa, the first two airlines to place orders for the type. Following the appointment of Bernard Lathi\u00e8re as Henri Ziegler's replacement, an aggressive sales approach was adopted. Indian Airlines was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300, ordering three aircraft with three options. However, between December 1975 and May 1977, there were no sales for the type. During this period a number of \"whitetail\" A300s \u2013 completed but unsold aircraft \u2013 were completed and stored at Toulouse, and production fell to half an aircraft per month amid calls to pause production completely. During the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with Korean Air on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. In September 1974, Korean Air placed an order for 4 A300B4s with options for 2 further aircraft; this sale was viewed as significant as it was the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus had viewed South-East Asia as a vital market that was ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'. It was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result, they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80. The savior of the A300 was the advent of Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS), a revised FAA rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner. In 1977, US carrier Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s as an in-service trial. Frank Borman, ex-astronaut and the then CEO of the airline, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel, even more economical than expected, in contrast to his fleet of Tristars and proceeded to order 23 A300s, becoming the first U.S. customer for the type. This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Aviation author John Bowen alleged that various concessions, such as loan guarantees from European governments and compensation payments, were a factor in the decision as well. The Eastern Air Lines breakthrough was shortly followed by an order from Pan Am. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft. In December 1977, AeroC\u00f3ndor Colombia became the first Airbus operator in Latin America, leasing one Airbus A300, named \"Ciudad de Barranquilla\". During the late 1970s, Airbus adopted a so-called 'Silk Road' strategy, targeting airlines in the Far East. As a result, The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by Japan Air System, Korean Air, China Eastern Airlines, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, China Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Indian Airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA 60-minutes rule for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. In 1977, the A300B4 became the first ETOPS compliant aircraft \u2013 its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 Garuda Indonesia became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new Boeing 767. In 1989, Chinese operator China Eastern Airlines received its first A300; by 2006, the airline operated around 18 A300s, making it the largest operator of both the A300 and the A310 at that time. On 31 May 2014, China Eastern officially retired the last A300-600 in its fleet, having begun drawing down the type in 2010. From 1997 to 2014, a single A300, designated A300 Zero-G, was operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a reduced-gravity aircraft for conducting research into microgravity; the A300 is the largest aircraft to ever have been used in this capacity. A typical flight would last for two and a half hours, enabling up to 30 parabolas to be performed per flight. By the 1990s, the A300 was being heavily promoted as a cargo freighter. The largest freight operator of the A300 is FedEx Express, which has 68 A300 aircraft in service. UPS Airlines also operates 52 freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute ETOPS. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters; large numbers were being converted during the late 1990s. The freighter versions \u2013 either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s \u2013 account for most of the world freighter fleet after the Boeing 747 freighter. The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched (A330 and A340), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives (A300-600ST Beluga Super Transporter). In March 2006, Airbus announced the impending closure of the A300/A310 final assembly line, making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300, an A300F freighter, performed its initial flight on 18 April 2007, and was delivered to FedEx Express on 12 July 2007. Airbus has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025. The useful life of the UPS fleet of 52 delivered from 2000 to 2006 will be extended to 2035 by a flight deck upgrade based around Honeywell Primus Epic avionics : new displays and flight management system (FMS), improved 3-D weather radar, a central maintenance system, and a new version of the current enhanced ground proximity warning system. With a light usage of only two to three cycles per day, it will not reach the maximum number of cycles by then. The first modification will be made at Airbus Toulouse in 2019 and certified in 2020. As of July 2017, there are 211 A300's in service with 22 operators, with the largest operator being FedEx Express with 68 A300-600F aircraft.\nOfficially designated A300B4-600, this version is nearly the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and horizontal tail. It has higher power CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines and uses the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU). Other changes include an improved wing featuring a recambered trailing edge, the incorporation of simpler single-slotted Fowler flaps, the deletion of slat fences, and the removal of the outboard ailerons after they were deemed unnecessary on the A310. The A300-600 made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year with Saudi Arabian Airlines. A total of 313 A300-600s (all versions) have been sold. The A300-600 also has a similar cockpit to the A310, eliminating the need for a flight engineer. The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.\nA300-600: (Official designation: A300B4-600) The baseline model of the \u2212600 series.\nA300-620C: (Official designation: A300C4-620) A convertible freighter version.

All A300s delivered between November 2002 and 12 July 2007 (last ever A300 delivery) were A300-600RFs.\nA300B10 (A310):\nIntroduced a shorter fuselage, a new, higher aspect ratio wing, smaller horizontal tail and two crew operation. It was available in standard \u2212200 and the Extended range \u2212300 with 9,600 km (5,965 mi) range in both passenger and full cargo versions. It was also available as a military tanker/transport serving the Canadian Forces and German Air Force. Sales total 260, although five of these (ordered by Iraqi Airways) were never built.\nA300-600ST:\nCommonly referred to as the Airbus Beluga or \"Airbus Super Transporter,\" these five airframes are used by Airbus to ferry parts between the company's disparate manufacturing facilities, thus enabling workshare distribution. They replaced the four Aero Spacelines Super Guppys previously used by Airbus.

The first version of the aircraft to be developed was the \u2212200 but this was later joined by the \u2212300 which then became the standard production version of the aircraft.\n\nA310-200:\nThe first A310, the 162nd Airbus off the production line, made its maiden flight on 3 April 1982 powered by the earlier Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4D1 engines. The \u2212200 entered service with Swissair and Lufthansa a year later. Late series \u2212200 also featured wing fences identical to those of the \u2212300.

Operators such as FedEx Express acquired modified ex-passenger A310s, usually starting with the \u2212300 version.\n\nThe Airbus A310 is a medium- to long-range twin-engined wide-body jet airliner that was developed and manufactured by Airbus, then a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers. It was the second airliner to be produced by the company, the first being the A300. The A310 is a smaller derivative of the A300, which held the distinction of being the first twin-engined widebody airliner. The origin of the A310 lies within design studies originally conducted for the earlier A300 programme, specifically the smaller A300B10MC (standing for Minimum Change) design. During the flight testing stage of the A300 programme, a number of airlines approached Airbus, expressing that there was also a sizable market for a smaller aircraft, leading to the company commencing studies on producing a separate airliner to produce such an aircraft. The design settled on for the tentative airliner, later designated as the A310, was essentially a fuselage shrink of the A300, furnished with a new wing and a lighter landing gear configuration to suit the smaller scale of the aircraft. It shared a very high level of commonality with the A300, particularly in terms of the cockpit and subsystems. These similarities enabled both aircraft to be manufactured upon the same production line. On 7 July 1978, Airbus decided to launch the A300B10 programme, which it had re-designated as the A310. Initially, the company planned to produce two distinct versions of the A310, these being the regional A310-100 and the transcontinental A310-200, the latter being capable of longer-range flights. On 3 April 1982, the first prototype A310 conducted the type's maiden flight. In April 1983, the A310 entered revenue service with launch customer Swissair. From an operational perspective, the cockpit of the A310 and the A300-600 share such commonality that a dual type rating could be achieved, easing the training of flight crews for both airliners. It was produced between 1983 and 1998, having been effectively succeeded by the Airbus A320, a newer narrow-body aircraft.\nOn 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to commence the joint development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. This collaborative effort resulted in the production of the consortium's first airliner, known as the Airbus A300. The A300 was a wide-body medium-to-long range passenger liner; it holds the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. The design was relatively revolutionary for its time and featured a number of industry firsts, making the first use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft; during 1977, the A300 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft, which was made possible due to its high performance and safety standards. The A300 would be produced in a range of models and sold relatively well to airlines across the world, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft during its production life. During the development of the earlier A300, a range of different aircraft size and capacity were studied by the consortium; the resulting Airbus A300B proposal was one of the smaller options. When the A300B1 prototypes emerged, a number of airlines issued requests for an aircraft with greater capacity, which resulted in the initial production A300B2 version. As the A300 entered service, it became increasingly apparent that there was also a sizable market for a smaller aircraft; some operators did not have enough traffic to justify the relatively large A300, while others wanted more frequency or lower aircraft-mile costs at the expense of higher seat-mile cost (specifically Swissair and Lufthansa). At the same time, there was great pressure for Airbus to validate itself beyond the design and manufacture of a single airliner. In response to these desires, Airbus explored the options for producing a smaller derivative of the A300B2. In order to minimise the associated research & development costs for the tentative project, Airbus chose to examine several early design studies performed during the A300 programme. The company ultimately chose to prioritise its focus on one option, which became known as the A300B10MC (standing for Minimum Change). As envisioned, the airliner's capacity was reduced to a maximum of 220 passengers, which was viewed at the time as being a desired capacity amongst many airlines. However, such a design would have resulted in a relatively small fuselage being mated to a comparatively large wing and oversized undercarriage; such an arrangement would have, amongst other things, made the aircraft consume an unnecessarily larger amount of fuel as it carried heavier weight than what was otherwise required. Another problem for the programme was presented in the form of inflation, the rate of which in the United Kingdom (one of the early members of the Airbus consortium) was around 35 per cent during 1979\u201380. This factor was responsible for significantly raising the programme's development costs and, as a knock-on effect, increase the per-unit cost of the resulting airliner. During the development of the A300, British manufacturer Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) had been appointed as the subcontractor to perform the manufacturing of the wing of the aircraft; shortly afterwards, the British government chose to withdraw from the newly formed venture during 1969. During 1977, HSA subsequently merged with three other British aircraft companies, resulting in the formation of British Aerospace (BAe). By this point, the British government had publicly indicated its intentions to rejoin the Airbus programme. During May 1976, the French government entered into a series of discussions on cooperation, during which its representatives stated that the placing of an order by British Airways (BA) was a condition for the re-admission of the United Kingdom into Airbus Industrie as a full partner. However, both BA and Rolls-Royce had not relinquished their will to collaborate with the Americans in future aircraft endeavours and, in BA's case, procure American aircraft. During the late 1970s, BA sought to purchase two separate types of aircraft in development by American company Boeing, initially known as the 7N7 and 7X7, which would develop into the 757 and 767, the latter of which being an intended rival to the upcoming A310, as well as the existing Boeing 747. Independent of the British government, BAe commenced its own dialogue between itself and American aircraft manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas for the purpose of assessing if BAe could participate any of their future programmes, although the company's chairman, Lord Beswick, publicly stated that the overall aim of the firm was to pursue collaboration in Europe. At the 1978 Farnborough Air Show, Eric Varley, the British Secretary of State for Industry, announced that BAe was to rejoin Airbus Industrie and participate as a full partner from 1 January 1979 onwards. Under the negotiated arrangement, BAe would be allocated a 20 per cent shareholding in Airbus Industrie and would perform \"a full part in the development and manufacturing of the A310\".\nFrom late 1977, prior to the Varley announcement, BAe had already commenced work on the design of the new wing at its facility in Hatfield. However, due to negotiations with Britain on its return to the Airbus consortium being protracted, alternative options were explored, including potentially manufacturing the wing elsewhere. At the same time as the British efforts, French aerospace firm A\u00e9rospatiale, German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm (MBB) and Dutch-German joint venture company VFW-Fokker were also conducting their individual studies into possible options for the wing of the prospective airliner. At the April 1978 Hanover Air Show, Airbus exhibited a model of the proposed A310. Its wing area, at 219.25 m2 (2,360.0 sq ft) was slightly larger than that studied, at 209 m2 (2,250 sq ft); its passenger cabin was 12 frames shorter than the A300,Note 2 accommodating typical passenger loads of 195 in two-class, or 245 in economy. However, during the next 12 months, almost every aspect was further refined. On 9 June 1978, Swissair and Lufthansa developed a joint specification for the aircraft, and within a month, announced that they would place the launch orders. On 15 March, Swissair became the first airline to place a firm order for the type, announcing that it would acquire 10 with a further 10 under option to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-9s on its major intra-European routes. Lufthansa was quick to place a $240 million 10-aircraft order; additional orders from French operator Air France and Spanish airline Iberia shortly followed. As a consequence of increasingly strong interest in the tentative airliner, coupled with the recovery of the industry during the late 1970s, contributed to Airbus deciding to launch the A300B10, which was now known as the A310, into production on 7 July 1978. During the latter half of 1978, an order for 10 A300s was placed by independent British airline Laker Airways, satisfying Airbus's demand for the placing of a British order for their aircraft. On 1 April 1979, Lufthansa decided to raise its commitment for the type to 25 orders, along with 25 options. Two days later, Dutch operator KLM signed its order for 10 orders and 10 options at \u20a4238 million. On 6 July 1979, Air France announced that it had raised its order from 4 to 35 airliners. Other airlines announcing orders for the A310 during 1979 included Martinair, Sabena and Air Afrique. Initially, a pair of distinct versions of the A310 had been planned by Airbus; the regional A310-100 and the transcontinental A310-200. The A310-100 featured a range of 2,000 nmi (3,700 km) with 200 passengers, whilst the A310-200 possessed a higher MTOW and centre section fuel, being able to carry the same load a further 1,000 nmi (1,900 km). Basic engines offered for the type included the General Electric CF6-45B2 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4. At one point, British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was openly considering offering an engine for the A310, the Rolls-Royce RB.207, however, it ultimately chose to discard such efforts in favour of a smaller three-spool design, the RB.211.\nThe range of the A310 exceeds that of the A300 series with the exception of the A300-600R, which in turn surpasses that of the A310-200. The greater range of the A310 contributed to the airliner being used extensively by operators on transatlantic routes. The A300 and A310 introduced the concept of commonality: A300-600 and A310 pilots can cross-qualify for the other aircraft with one day of training. Sales of the A310 continued through the early 1980s. On 3 April 1982, the prototype A310-200 airliner conducted its maiden flight; by this point, the type had accumulated a combined orders and options for 181 aircraft, which had been placed by 15 airlines worldwide, which had been a relatively superior start than that of the original A300. Over time, it had become clear that the longer-range series \u2212200 aircraft was the more popular of the two models on offer. During 1979, in response to the lack of demand for the A310-100, Airbus decided stop offering the lower gross weight model which had been originally proposed for Lufthansa; as a consequence, none of this variant were ultimately manufactured. During the early 1990s, demand for the aircraft began to slacken; there were no new A310 passenger orders placed during the late 1990s, in part due to the introduction of the newer and more advanced Airbus A330 during this time. As a result, during June 1998, the last delivery of the A310 was completed. The A310, along with its A300 stablemate, officially ceased production during July 2007, though an order from Iraqi Airways for five A310s had remained on the books until July 2008. The remaining freighter sales were to be instead fulfilled by the new A330-200F derivative. The A310 has been commonly marketed as an introduction to wide-body operations for airlines based in developing countries. The airline was replaced in Airbus' lineup by the highly successful A330-200, which shares its fuselage cross-section. Between 1983 and the last aircraft produced in 1998, 255 A310s were delivered. The A300 and A310 established Airbus as a competitor to Boeing and allowed it to go ahead with the more ambitious A320 and A330/A340 families. As of July 2017, 37 A310s remain in commercial service; major operators are Air Transat and Mahan Air with 9 aircraft each; Fedex Express (6), and 7 airlines operating 13 aircraft between them. The Royal Canadian Air Force currently operates a fleet of 5 Airbus CC-150 Polaris, civilian Airbus A310-300s, originally owned by Wardair, and subsequently Canadian Airlines International, after the airlines merged. The aircraft were then sold to the Canadian Government and have been converted for use as the primary long distance transport aircraft as part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's fleet of Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft.\nThe Airbus A310 was a medium- to long-range twin-engined wide-body jet airliner. It was a derivative of the A300, the aircraft having been originally initially designated as the A300B10. It was essentially a shortened variant of the earlier aircraft; however, there were considerable differences between the two aircraft. Specifically, the fuselage possessed the same cross-section but being shorter than the A300, it provided capacity for a typical maximum of 200 passengers. The rear fuselage was heavily re-designed, featuring altered tapering, while involved a move aft of the rear bulkhead to create additional capacity; this same design change was later transferred back to later variants of the A300, such as the A300-600 and A330/A340 fuselages. The wing of the A310 was redesigned, possessing a reduced span and wing area and incorporating simpler single-slotted Fowler flaps designed by British Aerospace shortly following its decision to join the Airbus consortium. Other changes to the wing included the elimination of the outer ailerons, which were occasionally referred to by the manufacturer as being \"low speed ailerons\", and the addition of electrically-actuated spoilers. The wing also featured common pylons, which were able to support all types of engines that were offered to customers to power the airliner. From 1985 onwards, later-built production A310s were equipped with wingtip fences for the purpose of reducing lift-induced drag. A limited number of alternations were also performed to the airliner's tail unit, such as the adoption of smaller horizontal tail surfaces. The A310 was furnished with a two-crew glass cockpit configuration as standard, removing the requirement for a flight engineer; Airbus referred to this concept as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit. The company had developed the cockpit to significantly enhance the aircraft's man-machine interface, thereby improving operational safety. It was outfitted with an array of six computer-based CRT displays to provide the flight crew with centralised navigational, warning, monitoring, and general flight information in place of the more traditional analogue instrumentation and dials, which were used in conjunction with a range of modern electronic systems. The same flight deck had been incorporated into the A300-600, a move which increased commonality between the two types and enabled a dual type rating to be achieved, this same approach was later used on many future Airbus aircraft. In addition to the two flying crew, provisions for third and fourth crew seats were present upon the flight deck. The A310 was initially launched with a choice of three engines \u2013 the General Electric CF6-80A (originally the CF6-45B2), the Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4D1 and the Rolls-Royce RB211-524B4. The specific Rolls-Royce RB211-524B4 engine intended for this initial application was not developed. General Electric powered A310-200s were originally offered with the CF6-80A3 (A310-203), but with the introduction of the A310-300, the CF6-80C2 became available for both variants. The initial offering was for the 53,000 pounds-force (240 kN) CF6-80C2A2 (A310-204/A310-304) engine and later on the higher thrust 59,000 pounds-force (260 kN) 80C2A8 (A310-308). Similarly Pratt & Whitney powered A310s were first offered with versions of the JT9D engines (both \u221222s and \u2212300s) but when the PW4000 powered A310 became available in 1987, the aircraft was offered with the 52,000 pounds-force (230 kN) PW4152 (A310-324). From April 1992 the higher thrust PW4156A 56,000 pounds-force (250 kN) was offered for the A310 (A310-325), with the PW4158A 58,000 pounds-force (260 kN) /-326 becoming available from 1996. The A310 was equipped with a modified undercarriage, derived from the A300; the landing gear were outfitted with carbon brakes, which were fitted as standard. The structure of the airliner featured a high level of composite materials throughout both primary and secondary structures, increased beyond that of the earlier A300. The A310 is outfitted with integrated drive electrical generators along with auxiliary power unit, which were improved versions of those used on the A300.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCrew in A310-200 - Two.\nLength in A310-200 - 46.66 metres (153 ft 1 in).\nHeight in A310-200 - 15.8 metres (51 ft 10 in).\nWingspan in A310-200 - 43.9 metres (144 ft).\nWing area in A310-200 - 219 m2 (2,360 sq ft).\nWing sweep in A310-200 - 28 \u00b0.\nCross section in A310-200 - 5.64 metres (18 ft 6 in).\n2-class in A310-200 - 220 passengers (20F + 200Y).\n1-class in A310-200 - 237Y 8-abreast.\nMaximum Payload in A310-200 - 32,834 kg (72,386 lb).\nExit limit in A310-200 - 275 passengers.\nLower deck cargo in A310-200 - 14 LD3 containers.\nMTOW in A310-200 - 144,000 kg (317,465 lb).\nMLW in A310-200 - 122,000 kg (268,963 lb).\nMZFW in A310-200 - 112,000 kg (246,917 lb).\nOEW in A310-200 - CF6\u201480: 79,207 kg (174,619 lb), JT9D: 77,397 kg (170,631 lb), PW4000: 79,166 kg (174,528 lb).\nMax fuel in A310-200 - 61,070 L 16,132 US gal.\nCruise speed (M) in A310-200 - Mach 0.8 (459 kn).\nMMO in A310-200 - Mach 0.84 (482 kn).\nCeiling in A310-200 - 41 100 ft.

The first version of the aircraft to be developed was the \u2212200 but this was later joined by the \u2212300 which then became the standard production version of the aircraft.\n\nA310-300:\nFirst flown on 8 July 1985, the \u2212300 is dimensionally identical to the \u2212200, although it provides an increased Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) and an increase in range, provided by additional centre and horizontal stabilizer (trim-tank) fuel tanks. This model also introduced wingtip fences to improve aerodynamic efficiency, a feature that has since been retrofitted to some \u2212200s. The aircraft entered service in 1986 with Swissair. The A310-300 incorporates a computerised fuel distribution system which allows it to be trimmed in flight, optimising the centre of gravity by shuttling up to 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of fuel in and out of the horizontal stabilizer tank, controlled by a Center of Gravity Control Computer.\nA310-300C:\nA convertible passenger/cargo version, the seats can be removed and cargo placed on the main deck.\nA310 MRT/MRTT:\nThe A310 has been operated by several air forces as a pure transport (A310-300 MRT), however several have now been converted to the \"Multi Role Tanker Transport\" configuration by EADS, providing an aerial refueling capability. At least six have been ordered; four by the German Air Force and two by the Canadian Forces. Deliveries began in 2004. Three were converted at EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany; the other three at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg, Germany.\nA310 Zero G:\nOne A310 unit has been redesigned to become a scientific research laboratory dedicated to weightlessness.

It also performs scientific flights, recreational flights under the Air Zero G brand, and movie special effects, such as for The Mummy with Tom Cruise. Astronaut Thomas Pesquet is one of the Novespace A310 Zero G pilots.\n\nThe Airbus A310 is a medium- to long-range twin-engined wide-body jet airliner that was developed and manufactured by Airbus, then a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers. It was the second airliner to be produced by the company, the first being the A300. The A310 is a smaller derivative of the A300, which held the distinction of being the first twin-engined widebody airliner. The origin of the A310 lies within design studies originally conducted for the earlier A300 programme, specifically the smaller A300B10MC (standing for Minimum Change) design. During the flight testing stage of the A300 programme, a number of airlines approached Airbus, expressing that there was also a sizable market for a smaller aircraft, leading to the company commencing studies on producing a separate airliner to produce such an aircraft. The design settled on for the tentative airliner, later designated as the A310, was essentially a fuselage shrink of the A300, furnished with a new wing and a lighter landing gear configuration to suit the smaller scale of the aircraft. It shared a very high level of commonality with the A300, particularly in terms of the cockpit and subsystems. These similarities enabled both aircraft to be manufactured upon the same production line. On 7 July 1978, Airbus decided to launch the A300B10 programme, which it had re-designated as the A310. Initially, the company planned to produce two distinct versions of the A310, these being the regional A310-100 and the transcontinental A310-200, the latter being capable of longer-range flights. On 3 April 1982, the first prototype A310 conducted the type's maiden flight. In April 1983, the A310 entered revenue service with launch customer Swissair. From an operational perspective, the cockpit of the A310 and the A300-600 share such commonality that a dual type rating could be achieved, easing the training of flight crews for both airliners. It was produced between 1983 and 1998, having been effectively succeeded by the Airbus A320, a newer narrow-body aircraft.\nOn 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to commence the joint development of the 300-seat Airbus A300.

On 6 July 1979, Air France announced that it had raised its order from 4 to 35 airliners.[citation needed] Other airlines announcing orders for the A310 during 1979 included Martinair, Sabena and Air Afrique. Initially, a pair of distinct versions of the A310 had been planned by Airbus; the regional A310-100 and the transcontinental A310-200. The A310-100 featured a range of 2,000 nmi (3,700 km) with 200 passengers, whilst the A310-200 possessed a higher MTOW and centre section fuel, being able to carry the same load a further 1,000 nmi (1,900 km). Basic engines offered for the type included the General Electric CF6-45B2 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4. At one point, British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was openly considering offering an engine for the A310, the Rolls-Royce RB.207, however, it ultimately chose to discard such efforts in favour of a smaller three-spool design, the RB.211.\nThe range of the A310 exceeds that of the A300 series with the exception of the A300-600R, which in turn surpasses that of the A310-200. The greater range of the A310 contributed to the airliner being used extensively by operators on transatlantic routes. The A300 and A310 introduced the concept of commonality: A300-600 and A310 pilots can cross-qualify for the other aircraft with one day of training.[citation needed] Sales of the A310 continued through the early 1980s. On 3 April 1982, the prototype A310-200 airliner conducted its maiden flight; by this point, the type had accumulated a combined orders and options for 181 aircraft, which had been placed by 15 airlines worldwide, which had been a relatively superior start than that of the original A300. Over time, it had become clear that the longer-range series \u2212200 aircraft was the more popular of the two models on offer. During 1979, in response to the lack of demand for the A310-100, Airbus decided stop offering the lower gross weight model which had been originally proposed for Lufthansa; as a consequence, none of this variant were ultimately manufactured. During the early 1990s, demand for the aircraft began to slacken; there were no new A310 passenger orders placed during the late 1990s, in part due to the introduction of the newer and more advanced Airbus A330 during this time. As a result, during June 1998, the last delivery of the A310 was completed. The A310, along with its A300 stablemate, officially ceased production during July 2007, though an order from Iraqi Airways for five A310s had remained on the books until July 2008. The remaining freighter sales were to be instead fulfilled by the new A330-200F derivative. The A310 has been commonly marketed as an introduction to wide-body operations for airlines based in developing countries. The airline was replaced in Airbus' lineup by the highly successful A330-200, which shares its fuselage cross-section. Between 1983 and the last aircraft produced in 1998, 255 A310s were delivered. The A300 and A310 established Airbus as a competitor to Boeing and allowed it to go ahead with the more ambitious A320 and A330/A340 families.[citation needed] As of July 2017, 37 A310s remain in commercial service; major operators are Air Transat and Mahan Air with 9 aircraft each; Fedex Express (6), and 7 airlines operating 13 aircraft between them. The Royal Canadian Air Force currently operates a fleet of 5 Airbus CC-150 Polaris, civilian Airbus A310-300s, originally owned by Wardair, and subsequently Canadian Airlines International, after the airlines merged. The aircraft were then sold to the Canadian Government and have been converted for use as the primary long distance transport aircraft as part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's fleet of Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft.\nThe Airbus A310 was a medium- to long-range twin-engined wide-body jet airliner. It was a derivative of the A300, the aircraft having been originally initially designated as the A300B10. It was essentially a shortened variant of the earlier aircraft; however, there were considerable differences between the two aircraft. Specifically, the fuselage possessed the same cross-section but being shorter than the A300, it provided capacity for a typical maximum of 200 passengers. The rear fuselage was heavily re-designed, featuring altered tapering, while involved a move aft of the rear bulkhead to create additional capacity; this same design change was later transferred back to later variants of the A300, such as the A300-600 and A330/A340 fuselages. The wing of the A310 was redesigned, possessing a reduced span and wing area and incorporating simpler single-slotted Fowler flaps designed by British Aerospace shortly following its decision to join the Airbus consortium. Other changes to the wing included the elimination of the outer ailerons, which were occasionally referred to by the manufacturer as being \"low speed ailerons\", and the addition of electrically-actuated spoilers. The wing also featured common pylons, which were able to support all types of engines that were offered to customers to power the airliner. From 1985 onwards, later-built production A310s were equipped with wingtip fences for the purpose of reducing lift-induced drag. A limited number of alternations were also performed to the airliner's tail unit, such as the adoption of smaller horizontal tail surfaces. The A310 was furnished with a two-crew glass cockpit configuration as standard, removing the requirement for a flight engineer; Airbus referred to this concept as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit. The company had developed the cockpit to significantly enhance the aircraft's man-machine interface, thereby improving operational safety. It was outfitted with an array of six computer-based CRT displays to provide the flight crew with centralised navigational, warning, monitoring, and general flight information in place of the more traditional analogue instrumentation and dials, which were used in conjunction with a range of modern electronic systems. The same flight deck had been incorporated into the A300-600, a move which increased commonality between the two types and enabled a dual type rating to be achieved, this same approach was later used on many future Airbus aircraft. In addition to the two flying crew, provisions for third and fourth crew seats were present upon the flight deck. The A310 was initially launched with a choice of three engines \u2013 the General Electric CF6-80A (originally the CF6-45B2), the Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4D1 and the Rolls-Royce RB211-524B4.[citation needed] The specific Rolls-Royce RB211-524B4 engine intended for this initial application was not developed. General Electric powered A310-200s were originally offered with the CF6-80A3 (A310-203), but with the introduction of the A310-300, the CF6-80C2 became available for both variants.[citation needed] The initial offering was for the 53,000 pounds-force (240 kN) CF6-80C2A2 (A310-204/A310-304) engine and later on the higher thrust 59,000 pounds-force (260 kN) 80C2A8 (A310-308). Similarly Pratt & Whitney powered A310s were first offered with versions of the JT9D engines (both \u221222s and \u2212300s) but when the PW4000 powered A310 became available in 1987, the aircraft was offered with the 52,000 pounds-force (230 kN) PW4152 (A310-324). From April 1992 the higher thrust PW4156A 56,000 pounds-force (250 kN) was offered for the A310 (A310-325), with the PW4158A 58,000 pounds-force (260 kN) /-326 becoming available from 1996.[citation needed] The A310 was equipped with a modified undercarriage, derived from the A300; the landing gear were outfitted with carbon brakes, which were fitted as standard. The structure of the airliner featured a high level of composite materials throughout both primary and secondary structures, increased beyond that of the earlier A300. The A310 is outfitted with integrated drive electrical generators along with auxiliary power unit, which were improved versions of those used on the A300.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCrew in A310-300 - Two.\nLength in A310-300 - 46.66 metres (153 ft 1 in).\nHeight in A310-300 - 15.8 metres (51 ft 10 in).\nWingspan in A310-300 - 43.9 metres (144 ft).\nWing area in A310-300 - 219 m2 (2,360 sq ft).\nWing sweep in A310-300 - 28 \u00b0.\nCross section in A310-300 - 5.64 metres (18 ft 6 in).\n2-class in A310-300 - 220 passengers (20F + 200Y).\n1-class in A310-300 - 237Y 8-abreast.\nMaximum Payload in A310-300 - 32,834 kg (72,386 lb).\nExit limit in A310-300 - 275 passengers.\nLower deck cargo in A310-300 - 14 LD3 containers.\nMTOW in A310-300 - 144,000 kg (317,465 lb).\nMLW in A310-300 - 122,000 kg (268,963 lb).\nMZFW in A310-300 - 112,000 kg (246,917 lb).\nOEW in A310-300 - CF6\u201480: 79,207 kg (174,619 lb), JT9D: 77,397 kg (170,631 lb), PW4000: 79,166 kg (174,528 lb).\nMax fuel in A310-300 - 61,070 L 16,132 US gal.\nCruise speed (M) in A310-300 - Mach 0.8 (459 kn).\nMMO in A310-300 - Mach 0.84 (482 kn).\nCeiling in A310-300 - 41 100 ft.

The A318 ( A320 ) carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,100 nmi (5,700 km; 3,600 mi). Final assembly of the aircraft took place in Hamburg, Germany. It is intended primarily for short-range service, although British Airways uses the aircraft on a London City Airport to New York-JFK Airport transatlantic route (albeit with a stopover in Shannon for refueling on the westbound leg). The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City. The A318 ( A320 ) entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, it has sold in only small numbers with total orders for 80 aircraft placed, with the order book currently being empty.\nThe first member of the A320 aircraft family was the A320, which first flew on 22 February 1987 after the program was launched in March 1984. The family was soon extended to include the stretched A321 (first delivery 1994), the shortened A319 (first delivery 1996), and the further shortened A318 ( A320 ) (first delivery 2003). The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircraft of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems, as well as side stick controls. The Airbus A318 ( A320 ) project had its origins in the collaboration among Chinese, Singaporean and European manufacturers. In May 1997, during the visit of French President Jacques Chirac to China, Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace (STAe), Airbus and Alenia signed a framework agreement that outlined the development of aircraft in the 100-seat range. The AE31X programme, as it was tentatively dubbed, besides being a global industrial programme and was would have significantly deepened Sino-European commercial ties.:24 With development costs estimated to be upwards of $2 billion, AVIC would have a 46 percent stake in the project, STAe 15 percent, and Airbus Industrie Asia 39 percent, the latter of which comprised Airbus and Alenia.:24 Final assembly would have taken place in China. The project never went past the exploratory phase.:56 It comprised two clean-sheet designs \u2013 the AE316 and the AE317. The AE316 would have had a length of 31.3 metres (102 ft 8 in), and the AE317, 34.5 metres (113 ft 2 in) .:39 The standard versions of both variants had a maximum take-off weight of 49.9 t (110,000 lb) for the smaller version and 54.2 t (119,000 lb) for the AE317, and would have been powered by either BMW Rolls-Royce, CFM International, or Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines.:39 Range was settled at 3,700 kilometres (2,000 nmi) for both standard variants, although there was a higher-gross weight version which had greater range and engine power.:39 The AE316 and AE317 would have seated a maximum of 105 and 125 passengers in five-abreast seating, respectively. Both would share a flight deck and fly-by-wire flight control system similar to that of the A320 family. Market research conducting during 1997 revealed that airlines wanted a smaller aircraft in the 70-80-seat range. As the project proceeded, there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus. China wanted a larger aircraft than originally envisioned. In addition, there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak business case.:56 STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project, in 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year. The A318 ( A320 ) is believed to have emerged from the AE31X project though an Airbus-only project, named the A319M5 in 1995, began before the AE31X cancellation.\nThe internal corporate designation, A319M5, was used as early as March 1995, as an A319 derivative with fuselage shortening of 0.79 metres (2 ft 7 in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in) behind. The final proposal was for an aircraft seating 107 passengers in a two-class layout with a range of 3,350 kilometres (1,810 nmi). The aircraft's production took advantage of laser welding, eliminating the necessity for heavy rivets and bolts. During the design process, the A318 ( A320 ) encountered several problems. The first one was the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 ( A320 ) customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 ( A320 ) orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318 ( A320 )s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 ( A320 ) as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept it in the same class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential. The aircraft is powered by two CFM56-5 or Pratt & Whitney PW6000 engines with maximum thrust ratings of between 96 and 106 kilonewtons (21,600 and 23,800 lbf). Launch customers Frontier Airlines and Air France took deliveries in 2003, with Frontier receiving its aircraft in July of that year. The list price of an A318 ( A320 ) ranges from $56 to $62 million, and operating costs are between $2,500 and $3,000 for each flight hour. Orders for the A318 ( A320 ) have been relatively slow, but slightly better than for its direct competitor the Boeing 737\u2013600. At 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model compared to 69 for the 737-600. The sales pace has been influenced by the strong sales of the Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E-Jets series. The biggest A318 ( A320 ) customers at 30 September 2017 were Governments, Executive and Private Jets (20), Air France (18), LATAM Airlines Group (15), GECAS (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).\nOn 10 November 2005 Airbus announced the A318 ( A320 ) Elite. The Airbus A318 ( A320 ) Elite is aimed at the medium-range market for flights of up to 4,000-nautical-mile (7,400 km) range, with a choice of two cabin layouts seating up to 18 passengers, and powered by CFM engines. Comlux Aviation became the launch customer by ordering three A318 ( A320 ) Elite aircraft. In September 2010, Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 ( A320 ) would become available with Sharklets, wingtip devices which reduce lift-induced drag and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption. The optional devices, which will also be available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division, will increase the range of the aircraft to 5,930 kilometres (3,200 nmi) \u2013 an increase of 185 kilometres (100 nmi) over a standard A318 ( A320 ) with 107 seats in a two-class configuration.\nThe Airbus A318 ( A320 ) is a small commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318 ( A320 ), CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Overall, the A318 ( A320 ) is over six metres shorter and around 3 t (6,600 lb) lighter than the A320. To compensate for the reduced moment arm, it has a larger vertical stabiliser. While initial concepts depicted the aircraft with a Boeing 737-300-style dorsal fin extension, the final design incorporated a fin tip extension, making it 75 centimetres (30 in) taller than the other A320 variants. Pilots who are trained on the other variants may fly the A318 ( A320 ) with no further certification, since it features a common flight deck and the same type rating as its sister aircraft. The A318 ( A320 ) is also referred to as the A318 ( A320 )-100 The A318 ( A320 ) is available with a variety of different maximum take-off weights (MTOW) ranging from a 59 tonnes (58 long tons; 65 short tons), 2,750 kilometres (1,480 nmi) base model to a 68 tonnes (67 long tons; 75 short tons), 6,000 kilometres (3,200 nmi) version. When equipped with CFM56-5B8/P engines, the A318 ( A320 ) is available with a 123,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. When equipped with CFM56-5B9/P engines, the A318 ( A320 ) is available with a 130,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on marginal routes. The lighter weight of the A318 ( A320 ) gives it an operating range 10% greater than the A320, allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to: London \u2013 New York, Perth\u2013Auckland and Singapore\u2013Tokyo, for instance. Its main use for airlines, however, is on short, low-density hops between medium-sized cities.\nIn March 2006, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certified a modified control software enhancement to the Airbus A318 ( A320 ) designed to allow the aircraft to perform steep approaches. The aircraft is the largest commercial aircraft certified by EASA for steep approach operations. The software modifies the control laws of the aircraft when the steep approach function is selected by the crew, by automatically deploying some of the spoiler panels to provide additional drag when the aircraft is in the landing configuration. It also provides alternative aural alerts to the crew and modifies spoiler deployment automatically below 120 feet (37 m) on landing. The A318 ( A320 ) steep approach procedure allows the aircraft to perform approaches at descent angles of up to 5.5\u00b0, as opposed to the standard 3\u00b0 for a normal approach. A test flight was conducted in May 2006 to prove the aircraft's steep approach and short runway performance by landing at London City Airport, where such steep approaches are required. The test flight also confirmed the aircraft's compatibility with the limited manoeuvring and parking space at that airport. Subsequently, in August 2009 Airbus delivered the first A318 ( A320 ) with steep approach capability to British Airways, which began operating the route the following month, eventually having two such aircraft capable of flights between London City Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. On the westbound leg from London, a stopover is necessary for refueling, which occurs at Shannon Airport, Ireland because weight restrictions are necessary in order to take off within the existing short runway length of London City Airport. On the eastbound leg from New York this limitation is not present and the aircraft can take all the fuel needed for the transatlantic route to London. As of November 2017, only one aircraft is serving the route, operated in a 32-seat all-business-class configuration.\nAlthough final assembly of A320 family aircraft takes place in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, Alabama, USA, final assembly of the Airbus A318 ( A320 ) was in Hamburg, Germany. The maiden flight of the Airbus A318 ( A320 ) took place from Finkenwerder airfield in Hamburg on 15 January 2002. The first customer delivery was on 22 July 2003 to Frontier Airlines. As of 30 September 2017, 67 A318 ( A320 )s remained in service with five airlines, in addition to governments, executive and private jets and undisclosed operators. Most A318 ( A320 ) aircraft retired from airline service have been scrapped due to the engine and components being more valuable than whole aircraft. Frontier Airlines, the launch customer that acquired A318 ( A320 ) aircraft between 2003 and 2007, retired their last A318 ( A320 ) by 2013.\nThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317. The former would have had an overall length of 31.3 m (102 ft 8 in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2 m (10 ft 6 in), at 34.5 m (113 ft 2 in). The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000s; with the MTOW of 53.3 t (118,000 lb) for the smaller version and 58 t (128,000 lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9\u201384.6 kN (17,500\u201319,000 lbf) and 84.6\u201391.2 kN (19,000\u201320,500 lbf), respectively. Range was settled at 5,200 km (2,800 nmi) and 5,800 km (3,100 nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants. Both share a wingspan of 31.0 m (101 ft 8 in) and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2 billion (\u20ac1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production to take place in China. Simultaneously, Airbus was developing Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own, the A318, at that year's Farnborough Airshow. The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus's product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2 ft 7 in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in) behind. These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout. Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100 nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210 nmi) with upcoming Sharklets. The 107-seater was launched on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft. After three years of design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002. Tests on the lead engine, the Pratt & Whitney PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption. Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members. After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003. On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred, entering service before the end of the month.\nTypically seating around 110 passengers, the A318 brings all the advantages of the A320 Family to a variety of possible routes suitable for a slightly smaller aircraft. With one aircraft in four sizes the A318 offers unbeatable fuel-efficiency, exceptional operational reliability and superior passenger comfort \u2013 qualities which help make the A320 Family the most successful aircraft family ever. Its enduring quality highlights the brilliance and innovation at the heart of Airbus.\nThe A320 leads the way in single-aisle comfort and even as the family member with the shortest fuselage, the A318 still offers the industry\u2019s best level of comfort in all classes.With the widest single-aisle cabin available, passengers can enjoy more personal space and relax in comfortable 18-inch-wide seats. The A320 also has plenty of overhead locker space so that carry-on luggage can be stored efficiently, while the wider aisle helps with boarding and disembarking. These advantages allow for minimum fuss when getting on or off, meaning less wait time at the end of a flight so that passengers can get to where they\u2019re going more quickly.\nWhen something works brilliantly, it makes sense to use it all the time. Like all the members of the aircraft family that introduced Airbus\u2019 revolutionary fly-by-wire control system, the A318 benefits from cockpit commonality, helping to reduce the cost of training, maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Not only are pilots qualified to fly any member of the A320 Family with the Common Type Rating, but training to switch between other Airbus aircraft is even easier with Cross Crew-Qualification (CCQ). Fly-by-wire offers significant advantages from the savings delivered through the reduction in weight to the reduction in pilot workload; another example of how Airbus improves performance through innovation.\nThe A318\u2019s cabin is flexible enough to deliver a range of options, allowing it to fulfil several roles. As the largest commercial aircraft certified to land at steeper-than-usual gradients, it is ideal for operations at such constrained locations as downtown airports \u2013 translating to significant cost and time savings for business travellers. Since 2009, British Airways has been operating A318s with \u201csteep approach\u201d capability from the in-close London City Airport to New York's JFK International Airport. These aircraft are equipped for premium service with seats that convert into full lie-flat beds, along with OnAir connectivity for passengers showing that even the smallest member of the A320 Family needn\u2019t compromise on luxury and amenities. \n\nCharacteristics:\nExit Limit in A318 ( A310 ) - 136.\n1-class max. seating in A318 ( A310 ) - 132 at 29\u201330 in (74\u201376 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A318 ( A310 ) - 117 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A318 ( A310 ) - 107 (8F @ 38 in, 99Y @ 32 in).\nCargo capacity in A318 ( A310 ) - 21.2 m3 (750 cu ft).\nLength in A318 ( A310 ) - 31.44 m (103 ft 2 in).\nWingspan in A318 ( A310 ) - 34.10 m (111 ft 11 in).\nWing area in A318 ( A310 ) - 122.4 m2 (1,318 sq ft).\nWing sweepback in A318 ( A310 ) - 25 degrees.\nTail height in A318 ( A310 ) - 12.56 m (41 ft 2 in).\nCabin width in A318 ( A310 ) - 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in).\nFuselage width in A318 ( A310 ) - 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in).\nOperating empty weight in A318 ( A310 ) - 39,500 kg (87,100 lb).\nMaximum zero-fuel weight (MZFW) in A318 ( A310 ) - 54,500 kg (120,200 lb).\nMaximum landing weight (MLW) in A318 ( A310 ) - 57,500 kg (126,800 lb).\nMaximum take-off weight (MTOW) in A318 ( A310 ) - 68,000 kg (150,000 lb).\nCruising speed in A318 ( A310 ) - Mach 0.78 (829 km/h; 515 mph).\nMaximum speed in A318 ( A310 ) - Mach 0.82 (871 km/h; 541 mph).\nRange, typical payload in A318 ( A310 ) - 3,100 nmi, 5,750 km.\nACJ range in A318 ( A310 ) - 4,200 nmi, 7,800 km.\nTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A318 ( A310 ) - 1,780 m (5,840 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A318 ( A310 ) - 1,230 m (4,040 ft).\nFuel capacity in A318 ( A310 ) - 24,210 L (5,330 imp gal; 6,400 US gal).\nCeiling in A318 ( A310 ) - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A318 ( A310 ) - CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fanPW6000A, 56.5 in (1.44 m) fan.\nThrust (\u00d72) in A318 ( A310 ) - 96\u2013106 kN (22,000\u201324,000 lbf).\nCockpit crew in A318 ( A320 ) - 2.\nExit limit EASA in A318 ( A320 ) - 136.\n1-class max. seating in A318 ( A320 ) - 132 at 29\u201330 in (74\u201376 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A318 ( A320 ) - 117 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A318 ( A320 ) - 107 (8F @ 38 in, 99Y @ 32 in).\nCargo volume in A318 ( A320 ) - 21.20 m3 (749 cu ft).\nLength in A318 ( A320 ) - 31.44 m (103 ft 2 in).\nWheelbase in A318 ( A320 ) - 10.25 m (33 ft 8 in).\nTrack in A318 ( A320 ) - 7.59 m (24 ft 11 in).\nWing sweepback in A318 ( A320 ) - 25 degrees.\nFuselage in A318 ( A320 ) - 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in) height, 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in) width, 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in) cabin width.\nMTOW in A318 ( A320 ) - 68 t (150,000 lb).\nMax. payload in A318 ( A320 ) - 15 t (33,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A318 ( A320 ) - 24,210 L6,400 US gal.\nOEW in A318 ( A320 ) - 39.5 t (87,100 lb).\nMinimum Weight in A318 ( A320 ) - 34.5 t (76,000 lb).\nSpeed in A318 ( A320 ) - Cruise: Mach 0.78 (447 kn; 829 km/h).\nRange, typical payload in A318 ( A320 ) - 3,100 nmi, 5,750 km.\nACJ range in A318 ( A320 ) - 4,200 nmi, 7,800 km.\nTakeoff run (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A318 ( A320 ) - 1,780 m (5,840 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A318 ( A320 ) - 1,230 m (4,040 ft).\nService ceiling in A318 ( A320 ) - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A318 ( A320 ) - CFM International CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fan.\nPW6000A, 56.5 in (1.44 m) fan in A318 ( A320 ) - IAE V2500A5, 63.5 in (1.61 m) fan.\nOverall length of A318 ( A310 ) is 31.44 m.\nCabin length of A318 ( A310 ) is 21.38 m.\nFuselage width of A318 ( A310 ) is 3.95 m.\nMax cabin width of A318 ( A310 ) is 3.70 m.\nWing span (geometric) of A318 ( A310 ) is 34.10 m.\nHeight of A318 ( A310 ) is 12.56 m.\nTrack of A318 ( A310 ) is 7.59 m.\nWheelbase of A318 ( A310 ) is 10.25 m.\nRange of A318 ( A310 ) is 5 750 km.\nMmo of A318 ( A310 ) is M0.82.\nMax ramp weight of A318 ( A310 ) is 68.40 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A318 ( A310 ) is 68.00 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A318 ( A310 ) is 57.50 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A318 ( A310 ) is 54.50 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A318 ( A310 ) is 24 210 litres.\t\nTypical seating of Pax A318 ( A310 ) is 107.\nBulk hold volume of Freight A318 ( A310 ) is 21 m\u00b3."}, {"title": "A319(A320).txt", "text": "A319:\n\nThe Airbus A319 ( A320 ) is a member of the Airbus A320 family of short- to medium-range, narrow-body, commercial passenger twin-engine jet airliners manufactured by Airbus.[b] The A319 ( A320 ) carries up to 160 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,700 nmi (6,900 km; 4,300 mi). Final assembly of the aircraft takes place in Hamburg, Germany and Tianjin, China. The A319 ( A320 ) is a shortened-fuselage variant of the Airbus A320 and entered service in April 1996 with Swissair, around two years after the stretched Airbus A321 and eight years after the original A320. The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. As of February 2018, a total of 1,469 Airbus A319 ( A320 ) aircraft have been delivered, of which 1,448 are in service. In addition, another 45 airliners are on firm order (comprising 15 A319ceo and 30 A319neo). As of 28 February 2018, EasyJet was the largest operator of the Airbus A319, operating 137 aircraft. In December 2010, Airbus announced a new generation of the A320 family, the A320neo (new engine option). The similarly shortened fuselage A319neo variant offers new, more efficient engines, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named \"sharklets\" by Airbus. The aircraft will deliver fuel savings of up to 15%.\nThe first member of the A320 family was the A320 which was launched in March 1984 and first flew on 22 February 1987. The family was extended to include the stretched A321 (first delivered 1994), the shortened A319 ( A320 ) (1996), and the further shortened A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems, as well as side stick controls, in commercial aircraft. The A319 ( A320 ) was developed at the request of Steven Udvar-Hazy, the former president and CEO of ILFC according to The New York Times.\nThe A319 ( A320 ) design is a shortened fuselage, minimum change derivative of the A320 with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies. The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings. After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus re-focused on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames. It would provide direct competition for the 737\u2013300/-700. The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12 ft 3 in). Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. High-density A319s, such as 156-seat aircraft used by easyJet, retain four overwing exits. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers. Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft is largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A or V2500-A5, derated to 98 kN (22,000 lbf), with option for 105 kN (24,000 lbf) thrust. With virtually the same fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650 km (3,590 nmi), or 6,850 km (3,700 nmi) with the \"Sharklets\". The A319's wingspan is wider than the aircraft's overall length.\nAirbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, and the A319's first customer was ILFC, who signed for six aircraft. Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus launched the $275 million (\u20ac250 million) programme on 10 June 1993. On 23 March 1995, the first A319 ( A320 ) underwent final assembly at Airbus' German plant in Hamburg, where the A321s are also assembled. It was rolled out on 24 August 1995, with the maiden flight the following day. The certification programme took 350 airborne hours involving two aircraft; certification for the CFM56-5B6/2-equipped variant was granted in April 1996, and the qualification for the V2524-A5 started the following month. Delivery of the first A319, to Swissair, took place on 25 April 1996, entering service by month's end. In January 1997, an A319 ( A320 ) broke a record during a delivery flight by flying 3,588 nautical miles (6,645 km) on the great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg, in 9 hours 5 minutes. The A319 ( A320 ) has proved popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, with 172 delivered. A total of 1,467 of the A319ceo model have been delivered, with 15 remaining on order as of 31 March 2018. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700.\n\nVariants:\nA319CJ:\nThe A319CJ (rebranded ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to 6 Additional Center Tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500 m (41,000 ft). Range with eight passengers' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 6,000 nautical miles (11,100 km). Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 ( A320 ) by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319. The aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Service Nfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737\u2013700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier's Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d'Entra\u00eenement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France's officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany's officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela, and it was the presidential aircraft of Italy, before it was replaced by an A340. Starting from 2014, a modularized cabin version of the ACJ319, known as \"Elegance\", is also available. It is said to be able to lower cost and ease reconfiguration.\nA319neo:\nThe A319neo will be part of the Airbus A320neo family of airliners developed since December 2010 by Airbus, with the suffix \"neo\" meaning \"new engine option\". It is the last step of the A320 Enhanced (A320E) modernisation programme, which was started in 2006. The A319neo replaces the original A319, which is now referred to as A319ceo, for \"current engine option\". In addition to the new engines, the modernisation programme also included such improvements as: aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets (sharklets), weight savings, a new aircraft cabin with larger hand luggage spaces, and an improved air purification system. Customers will have a choice of either the CFM International LEAP-1A or the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines. These improvements in combination are predicted to result in 15% lower fuel consumption per aircraft, 8% lower operating costs, reduced noise production, and a reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by at least 10% compared to the A320 series, as well as an increase in range of approximately 500 nautical miles (900 km). The A319neo is the least popular variant of the Airbus A320neo family, with total orders for only 33 aircraft placed as of 31 December 2017, compared with 4,042 for the A320neo and 1,920 for the A321neo.\nA319 ( A320 ) MPA:\nThe Airbus A319 ( A320 ) MPA (Maritime Patrol Aircraft) is a military derivative of the Airbus A319. Currently, it is in development by Airbus Defense and Space to compete against the Boeing P-8 Poseidon, which is a derivative aircraft of the Boeing 737 manufactured in the United States.\nA319LR:\nThe A319LR is the longer-range version of the A319. The typical range of the A319LR is increased up to 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 km) compared to the standard A319. Qatar Airways was the launch customer, receiving two A319-100LRs, PrivatAir received two A319LRs in 2003, and Eurofly acquired two in 2005.\nThe Airbus A319 ( A320 ) is a narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A319: CFM with its CFM56 and International Aero Engines with the V2500 engine.\nThe A319 is the next derivative of the baseline A320. The design is a \"shrink\" with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies. The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings. After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus re-focused on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames. It would provide direct competition for the 737\u2013300/-700. The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12 ft 3 in). Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers. Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft is largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A or V2500-A5, derated to 98 kN (22,000 lbf), with option for 105 kN (24,000 lbf) thrust. Airbus began offering the new model from 22 May 1992, with the actual launch of the $275 million (\u20ac250 million) programme occurring on 10 June 1993; the A319's first customer was ILFC, who signed for six aircraft.

In January 1997, an A319 broke a record during a delivery flight by flying 3,588 nautical miles (6,645 km) the great circle route to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hamburg, in 9 hours 5 minutes. The A319 has proved popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, who has orders for 172, with 172 delivered.\nThe A319 is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320. Also known as the A320M-7, it is 3.73 metres (12 ft 3 in) shorter than the A320; four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing were removed. The reduced seating reduces the emergency exits to six. With virtually the same fuel capacity as the A320-200, and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650 km (3,590 nmi), or 6,850 km (3,700 nmi) with the \"Sharklets\". Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040-pound-force (102.5 kN) V2522-A5 and 24,800-pound-force (110 kN) V2527M-A5 from IAE, or the 22,000-pound-force (98 kN) CFM56-5B/A and 27,000-pound-force (120 kN) CFM56-5B7. Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319's lower MTOW. The A319 was developed at the request of Steven Udvar-Hazy, the former president and CEO of ILFC according to The New York Times. The A319's launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993. Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993. Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995 and it was first introduced with Swissair in April 1996. The direct Boeing competitor is the Boeing 737-700. A total of 1,460 of the A319ceo model have been delivered, with 24 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.\nThanks to optimised use of cabin space, the A319neo \u2013 which performed its first flight in March 2017 \u2013 seats 140 passengers in two classes or up to 160 in a high-density layout with a range of up to 3,750 nautical miles.\nA319CJ:\nThe A319CJ (rebranded ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks (up to 6 Additional Center Tanks) which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,500 m (41,000 ft). Range with eight passengers' payload and auxiliary fuel tanks (ACTs) is up to 6,000 nautical miles (11,100 km). Upon resale, the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks and corporate cabin outfit, thus maximising its resale value. It was formerly also known as the ACJ, or Airbus Corporate Jet, while starting with 2014 it has the marketing designation ACJ319. The aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Service Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, MJET and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing 737\u2013700-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and Embraer Lineage 1000, as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range Gulfstream G650, Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier's Global 6000. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de Transport, d'Entra\u00eenement et de Calibration which is in charge of transportation for France's officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force for transportation of Germany's officials. An ACJ serves as a presidential or official aircraft of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\n\n\nCharacteristics:\nExit limit in A319 ( A320 ) - 160.\n1-class max. seating in A319 ( A320 ) - 156 at 28\u201330 in (71\u201376 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A319 ( A320 ) - 134 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A319 ( A320 ) - 124 (8F @ 38 in, 116Y @ 32 in).\nCargo capacity in A319 ( A320 ) - 27.7 m3 (980 cu ft).\nUnit load devices in A319 ( A320 ) - 4\u00d7 LD3-45.\nLength in A319 ( A320 ) - 33.84 m (111 ft 0 in).\nWheelbase in A319 ( A320 ) - 11.04 m (36 ft 3 in).\nTrack in A319 ( A320 ) - 7.59 m (24 ft 11 in).\nWingspan in A319 ( A320 ) - 35.8 m (117 ft 5 in).\nWing area in A319 ( A320 ) - 122.4 m2 (1,318 sq ft).\nWing sweepback in A319 ( A320 ) - 25 degrees.\nTail height in A319 ( A320 ) - 11.76 m (38 ft 7 in).\nCabin width in A319 ( A320 ) - 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in).\nFuselage width in A319 ( A320 ) - 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in).\nFuselage height in A319 ( A320 ) - 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in).\nOperating empty weight (OEW) in A319 ( A320 ) - 40.8 t (90,000 lb).\nMaximum zero-fuel weight (MZFW) in A319 ( A320 ) - 58.5 t (129,000 lb).\nMaximum landing weight (MLW) in A319 ( A320 ) - 62.5 t (138,000 lb).\nMaximum takeoff weight (MTOW) in A319 ( A320 ) - 75.5 t (166,000 lb).\nCruising speed in A319 ( A320 ) - Mach 0.78 (829 km/h; 515 mph).\nMaximum speed in A319 ( A320 ) - Mach 0.82 (871 km/h; 541 mph).\nRange, typical payload in A319 ( A320 ) - 3,750 nmi, 6,950 km.\nACJ range in A319 ( A320 ) - 6,000 nmi, 11,100 km.\nTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A319 ( A320 ) - 1,850 m (6,070 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A319 ( A320 ) - 1,360 m (4,460 ft).\nFuel capacity in A319 ( A320 ) - 24,210\u201330,190 L (6,400\u20137,980 US gal).\nService ceiling in A319 ( A320 ) - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A319 ( A320 ) - CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fanIAE V2500A5, 63.5 in (1.61 m) fan.\nThrust (\u00d72) in A319 ( A320 ) - 98\u2013120 kN (22,000\u201327,000 lbf).\nCockpit crew in A319 ( A320 ) - 2.\nExit limit EASA in A319 ( A320 ) - 160.\n1-class max. seating in A319 ( A320 ) - 156 at 28\u201330 in (71\u201376 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A319 ( A320 ) - 134 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A319 ( A320 ) - 124 (8F @ 38 in, 116Y @ 32 in).\nCargo volume in A319 ( A320 ) - 27.70 m3 (978 cu ft).\nUnit load devices in A319 ( A320 ) - 4\u00d7 LD3-45.\nLength in A319 ( A320 ) - 33.84 m (111 ft 0 in).\nWheelbase in A319 ( A320 ) - 11.04 m (36 ft 3 in).\nTrack in A319 ( A320 ) - 7.59 m (24 ft 11 in).\nWing sweepback in A319 ( A320 ) - 25 degrees.\nFuselage in A319 ( A320 ) - 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in) height, 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in) width, 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in) cabin width\nMTOW in A319 ( A320 ) - 75.5 t (166,000 lb).\nMax. payload in A319 ( A320 ) - 17.7 t (39,000 lb).\nOEW in A319 ( A320 ) - 40.8 t (89,900 lb).\nMinimum Weight in A319 ( A320 ) - 35.4 t (78,000 lb).\nSpeed in A319 ( A320 ) - Cruise: Mach 0.78 (447 kn; 829 km/h).\nRange, typical payload in A319 ( A320 ) - 3,750 nmi, 6,950 km.\nACJ range in A319 ( A320 ) - 6,000 nmi, 11,100 km.\nTakeoff run (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A319 ( A320 ) - 1,850 m (6,070 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A319 ( A320 ) - 1,360 m (4,460 ft).\nService ceiling in A319 ( A320 ) - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A319 ( A320 ) - CFM International CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fan.\nPW6000A, 56.5 in (1.44 m) fan in A319 ( A320 ) - IAE V2500A5, 63.5 in (1.61 m) fan.\nOverall length of A319neo is 33.84 m.\nCabin length of A319neo is 23.78 m.\nFuselage width of A319neo is 3.95 m.\nMax cabin width of A319neo is 3.70 m.\nWing span (geometric) of A319neo is 35.80 m.\nHeight of A319neo is 11.76 m.\nTrack of A319neo is 7.59 m.\nWheelbase of A319neo is 11.04 m.\nRange of A319neo is 6 850 km.\nMmo of A319neo is M0.82.\nMax ramp weight of A319neo is 75.90 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A319neo is 75.50 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A319neo is 63.90 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A319neo is 60.30 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A319neo is 26 730 litres.\nTypical seating of Pax A319neo is 140 (2-class).\nLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A319neo is 4 LD3-45W + 1 LD3/40-45W.\nMax pallet number underfloor of   A319neo is 4.\nBulk hold volume of   A319neo is 27.00 m\u00b3.\nTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A319neo is 24.20 m\u00b3."}, {"title": "A320(A320).txt", "text": "A320:\n\nThe Airbus A320 family consists of short- to medium-range, narrow-body, commercial passenger twin-engine jet airliners manufactured by Airbus. The family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321, as well as the ACJ business jet. The A320s are also named A320ceo (current engine option) after the introduction of the A320neo (new engine option). Final assembly of the family takes place in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany. A plant in Tianjin, China, has also been producing aircraft for Chinese airlines since 2009, while a final assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama, United States, delivered its first A321 in April 2016. The aircraft family can accommodate up to 236 passengers and has a range of 3,100 to 12,000 km (1,700 to 6,500 nmi), depending on model. The first member of the A320 family\u2014the A320\u2014was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was first delivered in March 1988 to launch customer Air France. The family was extended to include the A321 (first delivered 1994), the A319 (1996), and the A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems, as well as side-stick controls, in commercial aircraft. There has been a continuous improvement process since introduction. As of 31 October 2018, a total of 8,441 Airbus A320-family aircraft have been delivered, of which 8,053 are in service. In addition, another 5,943 airliners are on firm order. It ranked as the world's fastest-selling jet airliner family according to records from 2005 to 2007, and as the best-selling single-generation aircraft programme. The A320 family has proved popular with airlines including low-cost carriers such as EasyJet, which ordered A319s and A320s to replace its ageing 737 fleet. As of December 2017, American Airlines was the largest operator of the Airbus A320 family aircraft, operating 392 aircraft.[b] The aircraft family competes directly with the 737 and has competed with the 717, 757, and the MD-80/MD-90. In December 2010, Airbus announced a new generation of the A320 family, the A320neo (new engine option). The A320neo offers new, more efficient engines, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named Sharklets by Airbus. The aircraft will deliver fuel savings of up to 15%. As of October 2018, a total of 6,245 A320neo family aircraft had been ordered by more than 70 airlines, making it the fastest selling commercial aircraft. The first A320neo was delivered to Lufthansa on 20 January 2016 and it entered service on 25 January 2016.\nThe A320 is one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321), representing the most successful and versatile jetliner family ever. Seating from 100 to 240 passengers and flying throughout the world \u2013 and landing on every continent \u2013 an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds. From the heat of the desert to icy Antarctic runways, or from short runway urban environments to remote high-altitude airports, the A320 can take passengers anywhere. As the longest-range single-aisle aircraft, airlines and passengers alike have benefitted from the A320\u2019s exceptional efficiency and quality since its introduction, which has opened up exciting new travel possibilities throughout the world. Now with new engine options (NEO) available, the A320 Family continues to be the preferred choice for passengers and customers; setting the standard for the single-aisle market and securing its status as the world\u2019s best-selling aircraft of all time. This is an aircraft that you can rely on. This is the aircraft that changed the game.\nThe A320 Family is the most successful aircraft family ever and it was born ambitious. As the first civil aircraft to pioneer fly-by-wire technology, it has set the standard ever since its arrival and, thanks to significant annual investment of 300 million euros, the A320 Family continues to innovate. The A320neos boast the very latest engines, large wingtip devices (Sharklets) and an innovative cabin \u2013 continuing to go from strength-to-strength as the most comfortable, fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly single-aisle aircraft.\nAirbus is extending the award-winning Airspace interior to the A320 Family. A common cabin design language featuring the latest technology, Airspace offers elegantly-lit cabins, wider seats, large overhead storage bins capable of holding eight bags instead of five, iconic ceiling lighting, redesigned window bezels that provide passengers more window space with unobstructed views, new sidewall panels that provide an additional inch at shoulder level for extra personal space and a new spacious lavatory design. Passengers aboard A320 Family aircraft will be able to enjoy the distinct Airspace ambience, comfort, services and design starting in 2020. Airspace cabin interior enhancements trace their origins to the Airbus A350 XWB and A330neo widebody jetliners.\nWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9. Plans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737\u2013200 and DC-9. Germany's MBB (Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden's Saab and Spain's CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft. It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications. VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs. Alongside BAe (which at the time was not part of Airbus) were MBB, Fokker-VFW and A\u00e9rospatiale. The design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 \"Airbus\" in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident, which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\nIn June 1977 was set up a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme. It was based at the then British Aerospace (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus. This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s. It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737). The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of JET programme, Derek Brown. The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3. Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively. The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa. However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet In February 1981, the project was re-designated A320, with efforts focused on the former SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 2,850 or 1,860 nmi (5,280 or 3,440 km) using fuel from wing fuel tanks only. The Dash 200 had centre tank activated, increasing fuel capacity from 15,590 to 23,430 L (3,429 to 5,154 imp gal). They would measure 36.04 and 39.24 m (118 ft 3 in and 128 ft 9 in), respectively. Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of \"the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better\" and settled on a wider cross-section with a 3.7 m (12 ft 2 in) internal width, compared to Boeing's 3.45 m (11 ft 4 in). Although heavier, this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several stages of design, finally settling on 33.91 m (111 ft 3 in).\nThe UK, France and West Germany wanted the responsibility of final assembly and the associated duties, known as \"work-share arguments\". The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%, while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and research and development experience. In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses. France was willing to commit to a launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious. The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace (BAe) and estimated at \u20a4250 million, it was postponed for three years. On 1 March 1984 the government and the manufacturer agreed that \u20a450 million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.\nThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984. At this time, Airbus had 96 orders. Air France was its first customer with a \"letter of intent\" for 25 A320s and an option for 25 more at the 1981 Paris air show. In October 1983, British Caledonian placed seven firm order, bringing total orders to more than 80. Cyprus Airways became the first to place order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984, followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, then Inex Adria. One of the most significant order was when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, powered by CFM56 engines. During the A320 development programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, backed by Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it was essentially a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering speed of a turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans. Power on the A320 would be supplied by two CFM56-5-A1s rated at 25,000 lbf (112.5 kN). It was the only available engine at launch until the IAE V2500, offered by International Aero Engines, a group composed of Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engine Corporation, Fiat and MTU. The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of 25,000 pounds-force (110 kN), hence the name. It is 4% more efficient than the CFM56, with cruise thrust specific fuel consumption for the -A5 at 0.574 and 0.596 lb/lbf/h (16.3 and 16.9 g/kN/s) for the CFM56-5A1.\nIn presence of then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes from Toulouse. The flight test programme took 1,200 hours on 530 flights, European Joint Aviation Authorities certification was delivered on 26 February 1988.:50 The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March 1988.\nThe A320 leads the way in single-aisle comfort and even as the family member with the shortest fuselage, the A318 still offers the industry\u2019s best level of comfort in all classes.With the widest single-aisle cabin available, passengers can enjoy more personal space and relax in comfortable 18-inch-wide seats. The A320 also has plenty of overhead locker space so that carry-on luggage can be stored efficiently, while the wider aisle helps with boarding and disembarking. These advantages allow for minimum fuss when getting on or off, meaning less wait time at the end of a flight so that passengers can get to where they\u2019re going more quickly.\nWhen something works brilliantly, it makes sense to use it all the time. Like all the members of the aircraft family that introduced Airbus\u2019 revolutionary fly-by-wire control system, the A318 benefits from cockpit commonality, helping to reduce the cost of training, maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Not only are pilots qualified to fly any member of the A320 Family with the Common Type Rating, but training to switch between other Airbus aircraft is even easier with Cross Crew-Qualification (CCQ). Fly-by-wire offers significant advantages from the savings delivered through the reduction in weight to the reduction in pilot workload; another example of how Airbus improves performance through innovation.\nIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4\u20135% efficiency gain with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin. Engine improvements reducing fuel consumption by 1% were fitted into the A320 in 2007 with the CFM56 Tech Insertion and in 2008 with the V2500Select (One).\nIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglet intended to counteract the wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign \u2013 the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.[citation needed] Despite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that the new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits. On 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype. Airbus launched the sharklet blended wingtip device during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow: installation adds 200 kg (440 lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800 km (1,500 nmi). They save US$220,000 and 700 t of CO2 per aircraft per year. The 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) tall devices are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division. The winglets increase efficiency by decreasing lift-induced drag. In December 2011, Airbus filed suit in the western district of Texas over Aviation Partners' claims of infringement of its patents on winglet design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the A320neo. The first Sharklet-equipped A320 was delivered to AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a 450 kg (990 lb) payload increase or 100 nmi (190 km) longer range at the original payload.\nIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley reduces weight, increase revenue space and improves ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling. It offers a new air purifier with filters and a catalytic converter removing unpleasant smells from the air before it is pumped into the cabin and LEDs for ambience lighting and PSU. Offering 10% more overhead bin volume, more shoulder room, a weight reduction, a new intercom and in-flight entertainment system, noise reduction and slimmer PSU, the enhanced Cabin can be retrofitted. The flight crew controls the cabin through touchscreen displays.\nThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, it made its first flight on 25 September 2014 and it was introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it should be 15% more fuel efficient. Three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family is renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. After the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck. The end result was that the A320 consumed 50% less fuel than the 727[citation needed]. According to a study cited by the Stockholm Environmental Institute, the A320 burns 11,608 kilograms (25,591 lb) of jet fuel flying between Los Angeles and New York City, which is about 77.4 kilograms (170.6 lb) per passenger in an A320 with 150 seats. Its wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156 in) outside diameter, compared to 3.8 m (148 in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. Its cargo hold can accommodate Unit Load Devices containers. The A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs. Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, who also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.\nIt includes a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's flight deck is equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft. The only analogue instruments were the Radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator. From 2003, A320's feature liquid crystal display (LCD) units in the flight deck of its A318, A319, A320, and A321 flight decks instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include the main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which was an analog display prior to this. Airbus offers an avionics upgrade for older A320, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated. Digital head-up displays are available. The A320 retained the dark cockpit (where an indicator is off when its system is running; useful for drawing attention to dysfunctions when an indicator is lit) from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler's son. All following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training; for Roger B\u00e9teille, former Airbus president, this choice was one of the most difficult he had ever made.\nThe A320 is the world's first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300. At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots. Early A320s used the Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010. In 1988, the flight management computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.\nThe suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A320 series are CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney's PW6000 engines available only for the A318.\nThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama. Airbus produced 42 A320 per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017. As Airbus targets a 60 monthly global production rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 and it could assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 Airbus were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a 47% market share as the country should become the world's largest market ahead of the USA before 2027. In June 2018, along a larger and modernised delivery centre, Airbus inaugurated its fourth Hamburg production line, with two seven-axis robots to drill 80% of fuselage upper side holes, autonomous mobile tooling platforms and following Design Thinking principles.\nThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market in March 1988 with Air France and Ansett Australia, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.\nThe A320 family was developed to compete with the 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer's E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier to the A318/A319. Airbus has delivered 7,979 A320 series aircraft since their certification/first delivery in early 1988, with another 6,099 on firm order (as of 31 December 2017). In comparison, Boeing has shipped 9,864 737s since late 1967, with 8,358 of those deliveries since March 1988, and has a further 4,668 on firm order (as of 31 December 2017). By September 2018, there were 7,251 A320 family ceo aircraft in service versus 6,757 737NGs, while Airbus should deliver 3,174 A320neos compared with 2,999 Boeing 737 MAX through 2022. Airbus sold well the A320 to low-cost startups and offering a choice of engines could make them more attractive to airlines and lessors than the single sourced 737, but CFM engines are extremely reliable. The six month head-start of the A320neo allowed Airbus to rack up 1,000 orders before Boeing announced the MAX. The A321 has outsold the 737-900 three to one, as the A321neo is again dominating the 737-9 MAX, to be joined by the 737-10 MAX.\nA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals. A320-family maintenance should grow from $20.6 billion in 2018, for three quarters on A320s and A321s, to $24.5 billion in 2022.\nAirbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\". The follow-on aircraft to replace the A320 was named A3XX. Airbus North America President Barry Eccleston states that the earliest the aircraft could be available is 2017. In January 2010, John Leahy, Airbus's chief operating officer-customers, stated that an all-new single-aisle aircraft is unlikely to be constructed before 2024/2025.\nThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017. Technically, the name \"A320\" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA). With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced. These aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered to Air Inter \u2013 later acquired by Air France \u2013 and British Airways as a result of an order from British Caledonian made prior to its acquisition. The primary changes of the -200 over the -100 are wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity for increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogie main gear could not manage. Powered by two CFM International CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings of 98\u2013120 kN (22,000\u201327,000 lbf), its typical range with 150 passengers is 3,300 nmi / 6,100 km. A total of 4,512 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 220 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017. The closest Boeing competitor is the 737-800.\nThe best keeps getting better with Airbus\u2019 market-leading single-aisle jetliners. Ensuring the A320 retains its status as the best-ever aircraft, the A320neo (new engine option) is the culmination of several technological advances delivered by Airbus\u2019 continuing commitment and investment in the most successful aircraft family of all time. Bringing all the standards of comfort and incorporating new engine choices, aerodynamic improvements, and the latest cabin features, the A320neo Family will offer up to 20 per cent savings in fuel burn per seat by 2020, two tonnes of additional payload, 500 nautical miles of more range, lower operating costs, along with a nearly 50 per cent reduction in engine noise and NOx emissions 50 per cent below the current industry standard. Also, as a result of an optimised cabin space and increased exit limits, the A320neo accommodates 165 passengers in two classes or up to 194 in a high-density configuration. Designated the NEO Family, Airbus is providing the minimum change with maximum benefit, incorporating two latest-generation engine choices \u2013 CFM International\u2019s LEAP-1A and the PurePower PW1100G-JM from Pratt & Whitney \u2013 along with the use of fuel-saving Sharklets wingtip devices. A key contributor to the NEO\u2019s performance is Sharklets \u2013 which were pioneered on the A320ceo (current engine option). These 2.4-metre-tall wingtip devices are standard on NEO aircraft, and result in up to four per cent reduced fuel burn over longer sectors, corresponding to an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of around 900 tonnes per aircraft. Sharklets also are available for new-build and retrofit on A320ceo jetliners.\n\nCharacteristics:\nOverall length of A320neo is 37.57 m.\nCabin length of A320neo is 27.51 m.\nFuselage width of A320neo is 3.95 m.\nMax cabin width of A320neo is 3.70 m.\nWing span (geometric) of A320neo is 35.80 m.\nHeight of A320neo is 11.76 m.\nTrack of A320neo is 7.59 m.\nWheelbase of A320neo is 12.64 m.\nRange of A320neo is 6 300 km.\nMmo of A320neo is M0.82.\nMax ramp weight of A320neo is 79.40 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A320neo is 79.00 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A320neo is 67.40 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A320neo is 64.30 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A320neo is 26 730 litres.\nTypical seating of Pax A320neo is 165 (2-class).\nLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A320neo is 7 LD3-45W.\nMax pallet number underfloor of   A320neo is 7.\nBulk hold volume of   A320neo is 37.00 m\u00b3.\nTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A320neo is 31.70 m\u00b3.\nCockpit crew in A320 - 2.\nExit limit EASA in A320 - 195/190.\n1-class max. seating in A320 - 186 at 29 in (74 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A320 - 164 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A320 - 150 (12F @ 36 in, 138Y @ 32 in).\nCargo volume in A320 - 37.40 m3 (1,321 cu ft).\nUnit load devices in A320 - 7\u00d7 LD3-45.\nLength in A320 - 37.57 m (123 ft 3 in).\nWheelbase in A320 - 12.64 m (41 ft 6 in).\nTrack in A320 - 7.59 m (24 ft 11 in).\nFuselage in A320 - 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in) height, 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in) width, 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in) cabin width.\nMTOW in A320 - 78 t (172,000 lb).\nMax. payload in A320 - 19.9 t (44,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A320 - 24,210\u201327,200 L6,400\u20137,190 US gal.\nOEW in A320 - 42.6 t (93,900 lb).\nMinimum Weight in A320 - 37.23 t (82,100 lb).\nSpeed in A320 - Cruise: Mach 0.78 (447 kn; 829 km/h).\nRange, typical payload in A320 - 3,300 nmi, 6,100 km.\nACJ range in A320 - 4,300 nmi, 7,800 km.\nTakeoff run (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A320 - 2,100 m (6,900 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A320 - 1,500 m (4,900 ft).\nService ceiling in A320 - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A320 - CFM International CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fan.\nPW6000A, 56.5 in (1.44 m) fan in A320 - IAE V2500A5, 63.5 in (1.61 m) fan."}, {"title": "A321(A320).txt", "text": "A321 (A320):\n\nThe Airbus A321 is a member of the Airbus A320 family of short- to medium-range, narrow-body, commercial passenger twin-engine jet airliners manufactured by Airbus.[b] It was the first derivative of the baseline Airbus A320 aircraft. It represents a stretched-fuselage variant of the Airbus A320 and entered service in 1994 with Lufthansa, around six years after the original A320. The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. In December 2010, Airbus announced a new generation of the A320 family, the A320neo (new engine option). The similarly lengthened fuselage A321neo ( A321 ) variant offers new, more efficient engines, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named Sharklets by Airbus. The aircraft delivers fuel savings of up to 15%. The A321neo ( A321 ) carries up to 236 passengers, with a maximum range of 4,000 nmi (7,400 km; 4,600 mi) for the long-range version carrying onboard 206 passengers. Final assembly of the aircraft takes place in Hamburg, Germany, or Mobile, Alabama. As of 30 September 2018, a total of 1,777 Airbus A321 aircraft have been delivered, of which 1,755 are in service. In addition, another 2,137 airliners are on firm order (comprising 108 A321ceo and 2,029 A321neo ( A321 )). As of September 2018, American Airlines was the largest operator of the Airbus A321, operating 219 aircraft.\nThe Airbus A321 was the first derivative of the A320, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325. Its launch came on 24 November 1988, around the same time as the A320 entered service, after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured. The maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May 1993 Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft requested, respectively. The first of Lufthansa's V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March 1994. The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa. Final assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150 million (\u20ac135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480 million (\u20ac475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180 million (\u20ac175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.\nThe Airbus A321 is a narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. The aircraft would be a minimum-changed derivative of the A320, apart from a number of minor modifications to the wing, and the fuselage stretch itself. To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included and minor trailing edge modifications were implemented, increasing the wing area from 124 m2 (1,330 sq ft) to 128 m2 (1,380 sq ft). The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), giving the A321 an overall length of 6.94 metres (22 ft 9 in) longer than the A320. This is achieved by adding a 4.27 m (14 ft 0 in) front plug immediately forward of wing, and a 2.67 m (8 ft 9 in) rear plug. The length increase required the overwing exits of the A320 to be enlarged and repositioned in front of and behind the wings. The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate the increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600 kg (21,200 lb), taking it to 83,000 kg (183,000 lb). The A321 is the largest variant of the A320 family. The A321-200's length exceeds 44.5m, increasing maximum takeoff weight to 93,000 kg (205,000 lb). Wingspan remained unchanged, supplementing various wingtip devices. Two suppliers provided turbofan engines for the A321: CFM International with its CFM56 and International Aero Engines with the V2500 engine, both in the thrust range of 133\u2013147 kN (30,000\u201333,000 lbf).\nThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.

The first of Lufthansa's V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.\nAs the A320 began operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative. The A321 fuselage is stretched by 6.93 metres (22 ft 9 in) with a 4.27 m (14 ft 0 in) front plug immediately forward of wing and a 2.67 m (8 ft 9 in) rear plug. The A321-100 maximum takeoff weight is increased by 9,600 kg (21,200 lb) to 83,000 kg (183,000 lb). To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by 4 m2 (43 sq ft), to 128 m2 (1,380 sq ft). The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993. The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa. As the A321-100 range was reduced compared to the A320, the heavier and longer range A321-200 development was launched in 1995. This is achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990 L (790 US gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold. Its fuel capacity is increased to 30,030 L (7,930 US gal) and its maximum takeoff weight to 93,000 kg (205,000 lb). It first flew in December 1996 and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997. Its closest Boeing competitors are the 737-900/900ER, and the 757\u2013200. A total of 1,562 of the A321ceo model have been delivered, with 231 remaining on order as of 30 September 2017.\nThe industry-leading quality and efficiency of Airbus\u2019 A320 Family \u2013 of which the A321 is a member \u2013 is being further enhanced with its new engine option (NEO) jetliner versions. Incorporating Airbus\u2019 \u201cSharklets\u201d and two new engine choices, the A320neo Family offers maximum benefit with minimal changes from baseline A319s, A320s and A321s \u2013 delivering per seat fuel improvements of 20 per cent, along with additional range of up to 500 nautical miles/900 km. or 2 tonnes of extra payload. For the A321neo ( A321 ) \u2013 delivered to a customer for the first time in April 2017 \u2013 Airbus expanded seating capacity with optimised use of cabin space, increased exit limits and a new cabin door configuration. This \u201cCabin-Flex\u201d option increased the jetliner\u2019s maximum certified capacity to 244 seats, while still accommodating Airbus\u2019 modern comfort standard of at least 18-inch wide seats. The A321LR \u2013 a new variant of Airbus\u2019 A321neo ( A321 ), deliveries of which will begin in 2018 \u2013 will have the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner, able to fly routes of up to 4,000 nm. It is ideally suited to transatlantic routes, and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.\nA321LR: the long-range leader:\nThe A321LR \u2013 a new variant of Airbus\u2019 A321neo ( A321 ) \u2013 will have the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner, able to fly routes of up to 4,000 nm with 206 passengers while utilising extra fuel stored in three Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs). Ideally-suited to transatlantic routes, the A321LR allows airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft. Operators can outfit it in state-of-the-art two-class configurations with full-flat seats for true long-haul comfort, or in a single-class layout. The A321LR\u2019s long-range capability was certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 2018.\n\nVariants:\nA321-100:\nThe original derivative of the A321, the A321-100, featured a reduction in range compared to the A320 as extra fuel tankage was not added to the initial design to compensate for the extra weight. The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of the A321-100 was increased to 83,000 kg (183,000 lb). The A321-100 entered service with Lufthansa in 1994. Only about 90 were ever produced.\nA321-200:\nAirbus launched the heavier and longer range A321-200 development in 1995 which has a full-passenger transcontinental US range. This is achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990 L (790 US gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold. The additional fuel tankage increases the total capacity of this model to 30,030 L (7,930 US gal). These modifications also increased the maximum takeoff weight of the A321-200 to 93,000 kg (205,000 lb). This variant first flew in December 1996, and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997. Its direct competitors include the 757\u2013200 and the 737-900/900ER.\nA321neo ( A321 ):\nThe A321neo ( A321 ) will be part of the Airbus A320neo family of airliners developed since December 2010 by Airbus, with the suffix \"neo\" meaning \"new engine option\". It is the last step of the A320 Enhanced (A320E) modernisation programme, which was started in 2006. The A321neo ( A321 ) replaces the original A321, which is now referred to as A321ceo, for \"current engine option\". In addition to the new engines, the modernisation programme also included such improvements as: aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets (sharklets), weight savings, a new aircraft cabin with larger hand luggage spaces, and an improved air purification system. Customers will have a choice of either the CFM International LEAP-1A or the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines. These improvements in combination are predicted to result in 15% lower fuel consumption per aircraft, 8% lower operating costs, reduced noise production, and a reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by at least 10% compared to the A320 series, as well as an increase in range of approximately 500 nautical miles (900 km).\nA321LR:\nThe A321LR is a longer range variant of the A321neo ( A321 ), which Airbus predicts provides an overall 25\u201330% lower operating cost than the Boeing 757 on routes of up to 4,100 nmi (7,600 km; 4,700 mi) where a wide-body would be uneconomical. A321neo ( A321 ) weight variant with increased MTOW of 97 tonnes \u2013 often called A321LR or sometimes A321neo ( A321 )LR (LR = long-range) \u2013 transports 206 passengers in a 2-class layout with increased range to 4,000 nmi (7,400 km; 4,600 mi) by using three additional 2,990 L (790 US gal) fuel tanks. An extended 2-class layout additionally including a premium economy class with 164 passengers allows a range of up to 4,100 nmi (7,600 km; 4,700 mi). Historically this is the second MTOW increase after the initial A321-100 with 83 tonnes, which was quickly replaced by the -200 with 93.5 tonnes. In October 2014, Airbus started to offer it also as a replacement for the aging Boeing 757-200, including the modified version with winglets, known as the 757-200W. Compared to the 757-200W, Airbus predicts an A321LR gives overall 25\u201330% lower operating cost depending on the number of seats on routes where a wide-body would be uneconomical. Although Boeing has nicknamed a response to the A321LR as \"Middle of Market\" (MOM), they denied working on for example a new \"757MAX\", a modification of the 737 MAX 9 or Boeing 767 or the 787-3. On 31 January 2018, the A321LR completed its first flight. Test flights included a Leap-powered, long range 4,100 nmi (7,600 km) flight by great circle distance, flown in near 11h and the equivalent of 162 passengers over 4,700 nmi (8,700 km) including headwinds, with five crew and 11 technicians.\n\nCharacteristics:\n1-class max. seating in A321 - 236 at 28 in (71 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A321 - 199 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A321 - 185 (16F @ 36 in, 169Y @ 32 in).\nCargo volume in A321 - 51.70 m3 (1,826 cu ft).\nUnit load devices in A321 - 10\u00d7 LD3-45.\nLength in A321 - 44.51 m (146 ft 0 in).\nWheelbase in A321 - 16.91 m (55 ft 6 in).\nTrack in A321 - 7.59 m (24 ft 11 in).\nWingspan in A321 - 35.8 m (117 ft 5 in).\nWing area in A321 - 122.4 m2 (1,318 sq ft).\nWing sweepback in A321 - 25 degrees.\nTail height in A321 - 11.76 m (38 ft 7 in).\nCabin width in A321 - 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in).\nFuselage width in A321 - 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in).\nFuselage height in A321 - 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in).\nMaximum takeoff weight (MTOW) in A321 - 93.5 t (206,000 lb).\nMaximum landing weight (MLW) in A321 - 77.8 t (172,000 lb).\nMaximum zero-fuel weight (MZFW) in A321 - 73.8 t (163,000 lb).\nOperating empty weight (OEW) in A321 - 48.5 t (107,000 lb).\nCruising speed in A321 - Mach 0.78 (829 km/h; 515 mph).\nMaximum speed in A321 - Mach 0.82 (871 km/h; 541 mph).\nRange, typical payload in A321 - 3,200 nmi, 5,950 km.\nFuel capacity in A321 - 24,050\u201330,030 L (6,350\u20137,930 US gal).\nService ceiling in A321 - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A321 - CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fanIAE V2500A5, 63.5 in (1.61 m) fan.\nThrust (\u00d72) in A321 - 133\u2013147 kN (30,000\u201333,000 lbf).\nOverall length of A321neo ( A321 ) is 44.51 m.\nCabin length of A321neo ( A321 ) is 34.44 m.\nFuselage width of A321neo ( A321 ) is 3.95 m.\nMax cabin width of A321neo ( A321 ) is 3.70 m.\nWing span (geometric) of A321neo ( A321 ) is 35.80 m.\nHeight of A321neo ( A321 ) is 11.76 m.\nTrack of A321neo ( A321 ) is 7.59 m.\nWheelbase of A321neo ( A321 ) is 16.90 m.\nRange of A321neo ( A321 ) is 7400 km.\nMmo of A321neo ( A321 ) is M0.82.\nMax ramp weight of A321neo ( A321 ) is 97.40 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A321neo ( A321 ) is 97.00 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A321neo ( A321 ) is 79.20 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A321neo ( A321 ) is 75.60 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A321neo ( A321 ) is 32 940 litres.\nTypical seating of Pax A321neo ( A321 ) is 206 (2-class).\nMax of   A321neo ( A321 ) is 244.\nLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A321neo ( A321 ) is 10 LD3-45W.\nMax pallet number underfloor of   A321neo ( A321 ) is 10.\nBulk hold volume of   A321neo ( A321 ) is 51.00 m\u00b3.\nTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A321neo ( A321 ) is 42.70 m\u00b3.\nCockpit crew in A321 - 2.\nExit limit EASA in A321 - 230.\n1-class max. seating in A321 - 236 at 28 in (71 cm) pitch.\n1-class, typical in A321 - 199 at 32 in (81 cm) pitch.\n2-class, typical in A321 - 185 (16F @ 36 in, 169Y @ 32 in).\nCargo volume in A321 - 51.70 m3 (1,826 cu ft).\nUnit load devices in A321 - 10\u00d7 LD3-45.\nLength in A321 - 44.51 m (146 ft 0 in).\nWheelbase in A321 - 16.91 m (55 ft 6 in).\nTrack in A321 - 7.59 m (24 ft 11 in).\nWing sweepback in A321 - 25 degrees.\nFuselage in A321 - 4.14 m (13 ft 7 in) height, 3.95 m (13 ft 0 in) width, 3.70 m (12 ft 2 in) cabin width.\nMTOW in A321 - 93.5 t (206,000 lb).\nMax. payload in A321 - 25.3 t (56,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A321 - 24,050\u201330,030 L6,350\u20137,930 US gal.\nOEW in A321 - 48.5 t (107,000 lb).\nMinimum Weight in A321 - 47.5 t (105,000 lb).\nSpeed in A321 - Cruise: Mach 0.78 (447 kn; 829 km/h).\nRange, typical payload in A321 - 3,200 nmi, 5,950 km.\nService ceiling in A321 - 39,100\u201341,000 ft (11,900\u201312,500 m).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A321 - CFM International CFM56-5B, 68.3 in (1.73 m) fan.\nPW6000A, 56.5 in (1.44 m) fan in A321 - IAE V2500A5, 63.5 in (1.61 m) fan."}, {"title": "A330-200(A330).txt", "text": "A330-200 ( A330 ):\n\nThe A330-200 is a shortened, longer-range variant, which entered service in 1998 with Korean Air. Typical range with 253 passengers in a three-class configuration is 13,400 km (7,240 nmi; 8,330 mi). The A330-200 is ten fuselage frames shorter than the original \u2212300, with a length of 58.82 m (193 ft 0 in). To compensate for the smaller moment arm of the shorter fuselage, the vertical stabiliser height of the \u2212200 was increased by 104 cm (40.9 in). The \u2212200's wing was also modified; structural strengthening of the wing allowed the maximum takeoff weight of the \u2212200 to be increased to 229.8 tonnes (507,000 lb). The \u2212200 is offered with three engine types similar to those found on the \u2212300, namely the General Electric CF6-80E, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 700. Airbus also boosted fuel capacity to 139,100 L (36,700 US gal) by adding the centre section fuel tank, standard in the A340. A new vertical stabilizer was introduced in 2004 beginning with MSN 555. This newer fin is shorter in height by 50 cm (20 in) and was derived from the design of the vertical stabilizer of the A340-500 and -600, later becoming standard on all new A330-200s. In 2008, Airbus released plans for a higher gross weight version of the A330-200 to more effectively compete against the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new-build A330-200HGW had a 5 tonne increase in Maximum Takeoff Weight, allowing a 560 kilometres (302 nmi; 348 mi) range increase and a 3.4 tonnes (7,500 lb) payload increase. Korean Air became the first customer on 27 February 2009 with an order for six \u2212200HGWs. Deliveries of the first aircraft started in 2010. In mid-2012, Airbus proposed another version of the \u2212200 with the maximum gross weight increased by 2 t to 240 t. This version had its range extended by 270 nmi and carried 2.5 t more payload. It saw engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2%. In November 2012, it was announced that the gross weight was to be further increased to 242 t with the range extended by 350 nmi over the 238 t version. It was certified by the EASA on 8 September 2015 As of June 2018, 660 of the \u2212200 had been ordered, 627 of which had been delivered, with 614 aircraft in operation. The 2015 list price is $229 million. The \u2212200 competes with the Boeing 767-300ER and to a lesser extent the 767-400ER as well as with the new 787 Dreamliner.\n\nA modern classic, since its first flight, the A330 has been an example of a highly-innovative aircraft that delivers superior quality and efficiency. As a member of Airbus\u2019 family of widebody jetliners, the A330 benefits from a continuous investment of 150 million euro every year \u2013 integrating the latest developments from the A350 XWB and A380 Families to maintain its position as the best in its class, well ahead of its competition. With the arrival of the new engine option (NEO), the A330 Family continues to go from strength-to-strength. Technological advances in modern engines and wing design further enhance the performance of this aircraft; delivering savings on fuel burn while simultaneously helping the environment. \nFly with a smile on your face, the A330 Family continues Airbus\u2019 commitment to creating the most comfortable cabin for passengers and crew. Everyone flying on an A330 will be able to enjoy the extra personal space thanks to the widebody cabin and 18-inch-wide seats while state-of-the-art ambient lighting creates a welcoming environment; enriching the feeling of luxury throughout the aircraft. Personalised in-flight entertainment options offer an array of choices and now full cabin connectivity allows passengers to stay in touch with the world below \u2013 whether it\u2019s catching up on important emails or simply keeping social networks up to date. The A330neo is also the launch model for Airbus\u2019 new Airspace cabin interiors, making it the perfect example of the continuous efforts to take comfort to the next level. It\u2019s not just passengers who benefit from the Airbus\u2019 innovations in comfort and design. Cabin crew can enjoy their work in an environment that has been optimised to make doing their job as enjoyable as possible; state-of-the-art galleys allow the easy preparation and service of in-flight meals and comfortable crew rest areas ensure that all staff will be refreshed, creating the best possible environment to look after passengers.\nFlexible and reliable, capable of flying efficiently routes from 30 minutes to over 15 hours, the A330 is a highly-efficient aircraft. It seamlessly complements the A350 XWB, offering a similar passenger experience and \u2013 thanks to the Common Type Rating \u2013 pilots can be trained to fly both aircraft with minimum fuss. Boasting an operational reliability of 99.4 per cent, this is an aircraft that consistently delivers. Wherever you might be going, this is the aircraft that can get you there, on time and in the most comfortable way possible.\n21st century travel, benefitting from over 20 years of continuous incremental innovation, the A330 is the most modern and reliable family of aircraft in the sky. Typically flying around 247 passengers, it can be tailored to carry as many as 406 \u2013 providing a quality solution for every route today and in the future. The twin-aisle widebody aircraft provides all passengers with an abundance of personal space, and the modern cabin allows for 18-inch wide seats that can bring a level of comfort and relaxation to long-haul flights, even in economy. A330s also provide the quietest cabins in their class, while ambient lighting options add to the A330-200\u2019s stylish and classy design and help reduce the effects of jetlag.\nIn-flight entertainment, the A330-200 can offer passengers the most modern fourth-generation in-flight entertainment, including video-on-demand, as well as mobile phone and email connectivity via satellite. Even the longest flights can fly by with a range of options to make the time spent on board as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. Passengers can settle into a movie of their choice and even stay in touch with what\u2019s happening on the ground below, providing a tailored passenger experience that suits everyone from children to adults and holiday-goers to business travellers. Waiting until the end of an important flight to send or receive vital emails can be a thing of the past.\n\nThe Airbus A330-200 ( A330 ) is a medium- to long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner made by Airbus. Versions of the A330-200 ( A330 ) have a range of 5,000 to 13,430 kilometres (2,700 to 7,250 nmi; 3,110 to 8,350 mi) and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a two-class layout or carry 70 tonnes (154,000 lb) of cargo. The A330's origin dates to the mid-1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus's first airliner, the A300. The A330-200 ( A330 ) was developed in parallel with the four-engine A340, which shared many common airframe components but differed in number of engines. Both airliners incorporated fly-by-wire flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the A320, as well as the A320's six-display glass cockpit. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340. The A330-200 ( A330 ) was Airbus's first airliner that offered a choice of three engine types: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700. The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with Air Inter in January 1994. Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently-developed A330-200 ( A330 ) variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, a military tanker, the A330-200 ( A330 ) MRTT, and a corporate jet, ACJ330. The A330-200 ( A330 ) MRTT formed the basis of the proposed KC-45, entered into the US Air Force's KC-X competition with Northrop Grumman, where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker. Since its launch, the A330-200 ( A330 ) has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide-body airliners. Competing twinjets include the Boeing 767 and 777, along with the 787. The long-range Airbus A350 XWB was planned to succeed both the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340. Airbus intends to replace the current A330-200 ( A330 ) (referred to as the A330ceo (current engine option) since 2014) with the A330neo, which includes new engines and other improvements. As of October 2018, A330-200 ( A330 ) orders stand at 1,733, of which 1,424 have been delivered and 1,388 remain in operation. The largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 65 A330s in its fleet.\nAirbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft. Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects. In the mid-1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300. At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market. To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for \"twin aisle\". Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500 million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.\nThe first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982. They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold\u2014double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and 8.46 metres (27.8 ft) longer than the Airbus A300. By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and side-stick control. Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots. The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week's training, which reduces operator costs. The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections. Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing, a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected. With necessary funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df stated afterwards that \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, now officially designated as the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a \"4\" in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.\nFrom the beginning of the TA9's development, a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, and GE Aviation, was planned. GE Aviation first offered the CF6-80C2. However, later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from 267 to 289 kN (60,000 to 65,000 lbf). GE enlarged the CF6-80C2 fan from 236 to 244 centimetres (92.9 to 96.1 in) and reduced the number of fan blades from 38 to 34 to create the CF6-80E1 with a thrust of 300\u2013320 kN (67,000\u201372,000 lbf). Rolls-Royce initially wanted to use the 267 kN (60,000 lbf) Trent 600 to power Airbus's newest twinjet and the upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330, the Trent 700, with a larger diameter and 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. The A330-200 ( A330 ) became the first Airbus aircraft on which Rolls-Royce supplied engines. Similarly, Pratt & Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330-exclusive PW4168. The company increased the fan size from 94 in (2.39 m) to 100 in (2.54 m), enabling the engine to deliver 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. Like the CF6-80E1, 34 blades were used instead of the 38 found on the smaller PW4000 engines.\nIn preparation for the production of the A330-200 ( A330 ) and the A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In England, BAe made a \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with 15,000 m2 (161,000 sq ft) of floor area at Filton. BAe also spent \u00a35 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant. In Germany, Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm (MBB) invested DM400 million ($225 million) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary, including at Bremen, Einswarden, Varel, and Hamburg. France saw the biggest investments, with A\u00e9rospatiale constructing a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) final-assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Colomiers; by November 1988, the pillars for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall had been erected. The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process. On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. Domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options, while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options. Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330-200 ( A330 ) deliveries to start in 1993. Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March. BAe eventually received \u00a3450 million of funding from the UK government, well short of the \u00a3750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven. The wing-to-fuselage mating of the first A330, the tenth airframe of the A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the problem. At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders. The first completed A330-200 ( A330 ) was rolled out on 14 October 1992, with the maiden flight following on 2 November. Weighing 181,840 kg (401,000 lb), including 20,980 kg (46,300 lb) of test equipment, the A330-200 ( A330 ) became the biggest twinjet to have flown, until the later first flight of the Boeing 777. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours. On 21 October 1993, the Airbus A330-200 ( A330 ) received the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights. At the same time, weight tests came in favourable, showing the plane was 500 kg (1,100 lb) under weight. On 30 June 1994, a fatal crash occurred during certification of the Pratt & Whitney engine when an A330-200 ( A330 ) crashed near Toulouse. Both pilots and the five passengers died. The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one-engine-off worst-case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot, and the aircraft lost speed and crashed. An investigation by an internal branch of Direction Generale d'Aviation concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery. This led to a revision of A330-200 ( A330 ) operating procedures.\nAir Inter became the first operator of the A330, having put the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport, Paris, and Marseille. Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine's thrust reverser assembly. Thai Airways received its first A330-200 ( A330 ) during the second half of the year, operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul. Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994. MAS received its A330-200 ( A330 ) on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders. Airbus intended the A330-200 ( A330 ) to compete in the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the \"ETOPS out of the box\" or \"Early ETOPS\" approach taken by Boeing with its 777,[Nb 1] Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330-200 ( A330 ) using in-service experience. Airbus suggested that the A340 and the A330-200 ( A330 ) were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340's experience could be applied to the A330's ETOPS approval. The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330-200 ( A330 ) fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995.[Nb 2] Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330-200 ( A330 ) became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS\u2013240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.\nInitially, the GE90 was only one of three B777 options, and GE Aviation then-CEO Brian H. Rowe would have paid for the development of putting it on an A330; however, Airbus' strategy for long-haul was the four-engine A340, missing the market favouring twins. In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200. Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER. The plane was aimed at the 11,900 km (6,430 nmi; 7,390 mi) sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015. The project, with US$450 million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995. The A330-200 first flew on 13 August 1997. The sixteen-month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights. The A330-200's first customer was ILFC; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000, who became the type's first operator. As Airbus worked on its A330-200, hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340-200 in January 1994. On 4 January of that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport, was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main undercarriage well. The incident caused US$30 million in damage, and the aircraft took six months to repair. Consequently, operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997. Responding to lagging A300-600F and A310F sales, Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330-200F, a freighter derivative of the A330-200, around 2001. The freighter has a range of 7,400 km (4,000 nmi; 4,600 mi) with a 65 tonnes (140,000 lb) payload, or 5,900 km (3,200 nmi; 3,700 mi) with 70 tonnes (150,000 lb). The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version; however, it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous \"blister fairing\". This raises the aircraft's nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading, as the standard A330's landing gear results the plane having a nose-down attitude while on the ground. The A330-200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009. This marked the start of a four-month, 180-hour certification programme. JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April. The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division, Etihad Cargo, in July 2010.On 25 September 2013 at the Aviation Expo China (Beijing Airshow), Airbus announced a new lower weight A330-300 variant, optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows; China and India were recognised as prime targets. This variant could carry up to 400 passengers. The increased efficiency, however, comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction. On relatively short, yet congested routes, the A330-200 ( A330 ) competes against single-aisle jetliners. While the A330's operating costs in these conditions are not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321, the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency. Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased, using larger aircraft, such as the A330, is the only available option to increase capacity. The first customer for the A330-200 ( A330 ) Regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show.\nThe A330-200 ( A330 ) is a medium-size, wide-body aircraft, with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the airplane on the ground. Its MTOW grew from 212 tonnes (467,000 lb) at introduction to 242 tonnes (534,000 lb) in 2015, enhancing its payload-range performance. John Leahy states that it was intentionally being held down in takeoff weight and performance because Airbus avoided overlapping with the A340. The airframe of the A330-200 ( A330 ) features a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340-200/300. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[Nb 3] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (8.99 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The shared wing design with the A340 allowed the A330-200 ( A330 ) to incorporate aerodynamic features developed for the former aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 \"SuperFan\", which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (180 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (190 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (200 ft). At 60.3 m (200 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747\u2013200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The A330-200 ( A330 ) and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: 5.64 m (19 ft) and 5.26 m (17 ft). Typical seating arrangements are 2\u20132\u20132 six-abreast in business class and 2\u20134\u20132 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as fuel tank, flaps, ailerons and spoilers; they are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight. When necessary, the A330-200 ( A330 ) uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power. The A330-200 ( A330 ) shares the same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and the A340, featuring electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330-200 ( A330 ) also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents maneuvers from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.\nAs of December 2017, there are 1,358 examples of all A330-200 ( A330 ) variants in airline service, comprising 619 A330-200s, 38 -200Fs, and 733 -300s. The airline operators are Turkish Airlines (64), Air China (59), Cathay Pacific (58), China Eastern Airlines (50), China Southern Airlines (48), Delta Air Lines (42), and other operators with fewer aircraft. In November 2017, 1,190 are transporting passenger with 106 airlines, with the top 29 operating two-thirds of the fleet, 800 aircraft: 530 -200s and 660 A330-300s, mainly high-gross-weight with 36 original shorter-range A330-300s, half of them built since January 2010. Its average sector is 2,000 nmi (3,700 km) and their longest flight is 6,000 nmi (11,000 km) from Buenos Aires to Rome by Aerolineas Argentinas for the -200, and 5,000 nmi (9,300 km) from Paris to Reunion by Corsair and French Blue for the -300. Of operators of at least five A330s, 17 have ordered A350-900s, 11 have ordered B787-8/9s, 13 both, 3 have ordered A330neos and 2 both A330neos and A350s, and 14 haven't yet decided a replacement.\nBuilding on the proven success of its popular widebody A330 Family, Airbus officially launched the A330neo (new engine option) jetliner \u2013 comprising the A330-800 and A330-900 versions \u2013 in July 2014. As the newest member of the A330 Family, the A330neo is a truly modern aircraft that shares the values of Airbus\u2019 market-leading widebody product line: unrivalled cost-efficiency for airlines and superior comfort for passengers.\n\nVariants:\nACJ330:\nThe A330-200 is also available as an ultra-long-range corporate jet as the A330-200 Prestige.\nA330-200F:\nThe A330-200F is an all-cargo derivative of the A330-200 capable of carrying 65 t (140,000 lb) over 7,400 km (4,000 nmi; 4,600 mi) or 70 tonnes (150,000 lb) up to 5,900 km (3,200 nmi; 3,700 mi). To overcome the standard A330's nose-down body angle on the ground, the A330F uses a revised nose undercarriage layout to provide a level deck during cargo loading. The normal A330-200 undercarriage is used, but its attachment points are lower in the fuselage, thus requiring a distinctive blister fairing on the nose to accommodate the retracted nose gear. Power is provided by two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines. General Electric does not plan to offer an engine for the A330-200F. As of May 2018, Airbus had delivered 38 aircraft with four unfilled orders. The list price is $237 million. As well as new-build freighters, Airbus has proposed passenger-to-freighter conversions of existing \u2212200 airliners. The A330-200F is sized between the 767-300F and 777F, but trails both Boeing models in orders and deliveries.\nA330P2F:\nAt the February 2012 Singapore Airshow, the A330P2F freighter conversion programme was launched, engineered by ST Aerospace, supported by Airbus, and industrialised and marketed by their Dresden-based Elbe Flugzeugwerke joint venture. Targeting a 2016 introduction, Airbus then estimated a market requirement for 2,700 freighters over 20 years, half of these mid-sized, including 900 conversions. The A330-300P2F, adapted for express delivery and e-commerce lower densities, can carry up to 62 t (137,000 lb) over 3,650 nmi (6,760 km). Following flight tests in October 2017 and EASA Supplemental Type Certificate awarded in November, the first was delivered to DHL on 1 December. The A330-200P2F can carry 61 t (134,000 lb) over 4,250 nmi (7,870 km). Following June Flight tests and the STC in July, the first was delivered to Egyptair Cargo on 3 August 2018.\nA330-800neo:\nThe Airbus A330-800neo will retain the fuselage length of the A330-200, with cabin optimisation allowing up to six additional seats. It will feature new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines with a 10:1 bypass delivering 320 kN (72,000 lbf), improved aerodynamics including A350-style winglets increasing the span by 3.7 m (12 ft) to 64 m (210 ft), and is scheduled to enter service in early 2018. It should cover 7500 nm (13,900 km) with 257 passengers (406 max). The A330-800neo's maiden flight took place on 6 November 2018.\nA330-900neo:\nThe Airbus Airbus A330-900neo will keep the A330-300 fuselage with 10 more seats thanks to cabin optimisation. With the same engine and wing improvements, it should burn 14% less fuel per seat than the A330-300 on a 4,000 nmi flight. It should travel 6550 nm (12,130 km) with 287 passengers (440 max).\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A330-200 - Two.\nCockpit crew in A330-200F - Two.\nCapacity in A330-200 - 246 (36J @ 60 in + 210Y @ 32 in).\nCapacity in A330-200F - 70,000 kg (154,324 lb).\nMax seating in A330-200 - 406.\nLength in A330-200 - 58.82 m (192.98 ft).\nLength in A330-200F - 58.82 m (192.98 ft).\nSpan in A330-200 - Wing: 60.3 m (197.83 ft), Main gear: 12.61 m (41.37 ft).\nSpan in A330-200F - Wing: 60.3 m (197.83 ft), Main gear: 12.61 m (41.37 ft).\nWing in A330-200 - 361.6 m\u00b2 (3,892 ft\u00b2), 25% chord wingsweep: 30\u00b0, 10.06 Aspect ratio.\nWing in A330-200F - 361.6 m\u00b2 (3,892 ft\u00b2), 25% chord wingsweep: 30\u00b0, 10.06 Aspect ratio.\nHeight in A330-200 - 17.39m / 57\u2019.\nHeight in A330-200F - 16.90m / 55\u20195\u2019\u2019.\nFuselage in A330-200 - 5.64 m (222 in) diameter, 5.26 m (207 in) cabin width.\nFuselage in A330-200F - 5.64 m (222 in) diameter, 5.26 m (207 in) cabin width.\nSeat width in A330-200 - 0.46 m (18 in) in 8 abreast economy, 0.53 m (21 in) in 6 abreast business.\nSeat width in A330-200F - 0.46 m (18 in) in 8 abreast economy, 0.53 m (21 in) in 6 abreast business.\nCargo volume in A330-200 - 132.4 m\u00b3 (4673 ft\u00b3).\nCargo volume in A330-200F - 469.2 m\u00b3 (16567 ft\u00b3).\nMTOW in A330-200 - 242,000 kg (533,519 lb).\nMTOW in A330-200F - 233,000 kg (513,677 lb).\nOEW in A330-200 - 120,600 kg (265,900 lb).\nOEW in A330-200F - 109,400 kg (241,200 lb).\nMax Payload in A330-200 - 49,400 kg (108,900 lb).\nMax Payload in A330-200F - 68,600 kg (151,200 lb).\nFuel capacity in A330-200 - 139,090 l (36,744 US gal) - 109,185 kg (240,711 lb).\nFuel capacity in A330-200F - 139,090 l (36,744 US gal) - 109,185 kg (240,711 lb).\nEngines (\u00d72) in A330-200 - GE CF6 (except -200F) / PW4000 / Trent 700.\nEngines (\u00d72) in A330-200F - GE CF6 (except -200F) / PW4000 / Trent 700.\nThrust (\u00d72) in A330-200 - 64,500\u201371,100 lbf (287\u2013316 kN).\nThrust (\u00d72) in A330-200F - 64,500\u201371,100 lbf (287\u2013316 kN).\nCruise in A330-200 - Mach 0.82 (470 kn; 871 km/h).\nCruise in A330-200F - Mach 0.82 (470 kn; 871 km/h).\nRange in A330-200 - 13,450 km / 7,250 nm (247 pax).\nRange in A330-200F - 7,400 km / 4,000 nm.\nRunway in A330-200 - Takeoff: 2,770 m (9,110 ft), Landing: 1,730 m (5,680 ft).\nRunway in A330-200F - Takeoff: 2,770 m (9,110 ft), Landing: 1,730 m (5,680 ft).\nOverall length of A330-200 is 58.82 m.\nCabin length of A330-200 is 45.00 m.\nFuselage width of A330-200 is 5.64 m.\nMax cabin width of A330-200 is 5.26 m.\nWing span (geometric) of A330-200 is 60.30 m.\nHeight of A330-200 is 17.39 m.\nTrack of A330-200 is 10.68 m.\nWheelbase of A330-200 is 22.18 m.\nRange of A330-200 is 13 450 km.\nMmo of A330-200 is M0.86.\nMax ramp weight of A330-200 is 242.90 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A330-200 is 242.00 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A330-200 is 182.00 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A330-200 is 170.00 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A330-200 is 139 090 litres.\nTypical seating of Pax A330-200 is 247.\nMax of   A330-200 is 406.\nLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A330-200 is 27.\nMax pallet number underfloor of   A330-200 is 8+3 LD3.\nBulk hold volume of   A330-200 is 19.70 m\u00b3.\nTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A330-200 is 136.0 m\u00b3."}, {"title": "A330-300(A330).txt", "text": "A330-300 ( A330 ):\n\nThe Airbus A330-300 ( A330 ) is a medium- to long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner made by Airbus. Versions of the A330-300 ( A330 ) have a range of 5,000 to 13,430 kilometres (2,700 to 7,250 nmi; 3,110 to 8,350 mi) and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a two-class layout or carry 70 tonnes (154,000 lb) of cargo. The A330's origin dates to the mid-1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus's first airliner, the A300. The A330-300 ( A330 ) was developed in parallel with the four-engine A340, which shared many common airframe components but differed in number of engines. Both airliners incorporated fly-by-wire flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the A320, as well as the A320's six-display glass cockpit. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340. The A330-300 ( A330 ) was Airbus's first airliner that offered a choice of three engine types: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700. The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with Air Inter in January 1994. Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently-developed A330-300 ( A330 ) variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, a military tanker, the A330-300 ( A330 ) MRTT, and a corporate jet, ACJ330. The A330-300 ( A330 ) MRTT formed the basis of the proposed KC-45, entered into the US Air Force's KC-X competition with Northrop Grumman, where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker. Since its launch, the A330-300 ( A330 ) has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide-body airliners. Competing twinjets include the Boeing 767 and 777, along with the 787. The long-range Airbus A350 XWB was planned to succeed both the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340. Airbus intends to replace the current A330-300 ( A330 ) (referred to as the A330ceo (current engine option) since 2014) with the A330neo, which includes new engines and other improvements. As of October 2018, A330-300 ( A330 ) orders stand at 1,733, of which 1,424 have been delivered and 1,388 remain in operation. The largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 65 A330s in its fleet.\nAirbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft. Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects. In the mid-1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300. At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market. To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for \"twin aisle\". Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500 million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.\nThe first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982. They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold\u2014double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and 8.46 metres (27.8 ft) longer than the Airbus A300. By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and side-stick control. Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots. The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week's training, which reduces operator costs. The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections. Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing, a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected. With necessary funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df stated afterwards that \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, now officially designated as the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a \"4\" in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.\nFrom the beginning of the TA9's development, a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, and GE Aviation, was planned. GE Aviation first offered the CF6-80C2. However, later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from 267 to 289 kN (60,000 to 65,000 lbf). GE enlarged the CF6-80C2 fan from 236 to 244 centimetres (92.9 to 96.1 in) and reduced the number of fan blades from 38 to 34 to create the CF6-80E1 with a thrust of 300\u2013320 kN (67,000\u201372,000 lbf). Rolls-Royce initially wanted to use the 267 kN (60,000 lbf) Trent 600 to power Airbus's newest twinjet and the upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330, the Trent 700, with a larger diameter and 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. The A330-300 ( A330 ) became the first Airbus aircraft on which Rolls-Royce supplied engines. Similarly, Pratt & Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330-exclusive PW4168. The company increased the fan size from 94 in (2.39 m) to 100 in (2.54 m), enabling the engine to deliver 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. Like the CF6-80E1, 34 blades were used instead of the 38 found on the smaller PW4000 engines.\nIn preparation for the production of the A330-300 ( A330 ) and the A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In England, BAe made a \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with 15,000 m2 (161,000 sq ft) of floor area at Filton. BAe also spent \u00a35 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant. In Germany, Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm (MBB) invested DM400 million ($225 million) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary, including at Bremen, Einswarden, Varel, and Hamburg. France saw the biggest investments, with A\u00e9rospatiale constructing a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) final-assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Colomiers; by November 1988, the pillars for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall had been erected. The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process. On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. Domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options, while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options. Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330-300 ( A330 ) deliveries to start in 1993. Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March. BAe eventually received \u00a3450 million of funding from the UK government, well short of the \u00a3750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven. The wing-to-fuselage mating of the first A330, the tenth airframe of the A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the problem. At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders. The first completed A330-300 ( A330 ) was rolled out on 14 October 1992, with the maiden flight following on 2 November. Weighing 181,840 kg (401,000 lb), including 20,980 kg (46,300 lb) of test equipment, the A330-300 ( A330 ) became the biggest twinjet to have flown, until the later first flight of the Boeing 777. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours. On 21 October 1993, the Airbus A330-300 ( A330 ) received the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights. At the same time, weight tests came in favourable, showing the plane was 500 kg (1,100 lb) under weight. On 30 June 1994, a fatal crash occurred during certification of the Pratt & Whitney engine when an A330-300 ( A330 ) crashed near Toulouse. Both pilots and the five passengers died. The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one-engine-off worst-case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot, and the aircraft lost speed and crashed. An investigation by an internal branch of Direction Generale d'Aviation concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery. This led to a revision of A330-300 ( A330 ) operating procedures.\nAir Inter became the first operator of the A330, having put the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport, Paris, and Marseille. Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine's thrust reverser assembly. Thai Airways received its first A330-300 ( A330 ) during the second half of the year, operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul. Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994. MAS received its A330-300 ( A330 ) on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders. Airbus intended the A330-300 ( A330 ) to compete in the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the \"ETOPS out of the box\" or \"Early ETOPS\" approach taken by Boeing with its 777,[Nb 1] Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330-300 ( A330 ) using in-service experience. Airbus suggested that the A340 and the A330-300 ( A330 ) were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340's experience could be applied to the A330's ETOPS approval. The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330-300 ( A330 ) fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995.[Nb 2] Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330-300 ( A330 ) became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS\u2013240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.\nInitially, the GE90 was only one of three B777 options, and GE Aviation then-CEO Brian H. Rowe would have paid for the development of putting it on an A330; however, Airbus' strategy for long-haul was the four-engine A340, missing the market favouring twins. In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200. Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER. The plane was aimed at the 11,900 km (6,430 nmi; 7,390 mi) sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015. The project, with US$450 million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995. The A330-200 first flew on 13 August 1997. The sixteen-month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights. The A330-200's first customer was ILFC; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000, who became the type's first operator. As Airbus worked on its A330-200, hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340-200 in January 1994. On 4 January of that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport, was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main undercarriage well. The incident caused US$30 million in damage, and the aircraft took six months to repair. Consequently, operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997. Responding to lagging A300-600F and A310F sales, Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330-200F, a freighter derivative of the A330-200, around 2001. The freighter has a range of 7,400 km (4,000 nmi; 4,600 mi) with a 65 tonnes (140,000 lb) payload, or 5,900 km (3,200 nmi; 3,700 mi) with 70 tonnes (150,000 lb). The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version; however, it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous \"blister fairing\". This raises the aircraft's nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading, as the standard A330's landing gear results the plane having a nose-down attitude while on the ground. The A330-200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009. This marked the start of a four-month, 180-hour certification programme. JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April. The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division, Etihad Cargo, in July 2010.On 25 September 2013 at the Aviation Expo China (Beijing Airshow), Airbus announced a new lower weight A330-300 variant, optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows; China and India were recognised as prime targets. This variant could carry up to 400 passengers. The increased efficiency, however, comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction. On relatively short, yet congested routes, the A330-300 ( A330 ) competes against single-aisle jetliners. While the A330's operating costs in these conditions are not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321, the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency. Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased, using larger aircraft, such as the A330, is the only available option to increase capacity. The first customer for the A330-300 ( A330 ) Regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show.\nThe A330-300 ( A330 ) is a medium-size, wide-body aircraft, with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the airplane on the ground. Its MTOW grew from 212 tonnes (467,000 lb) at introduction to 242 tonnes (534,000 lb) in 2015, enhancing its payload-range performance. John Leahy states that it was intentionally being held down in takeoff weight and performance because Airbus avoided overlapping with the A340. The airframe of the A330-300 ( A330 ) features a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340-200/300. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[Nb 3] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (8.99 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The shared wing design with the A340 allowed the A330-300 ( A330 ) to incorporate aerodynamic features developed for the former aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 \"SuperFan\", which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (180 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (190 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (200 ft). At 60.3 m (200 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747\u2013200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The A330-300 ( A330 ) and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: 5.64 m (19 ft) and 5.26 m (17 ft). Typical seating arrangements are 2\u20132\u20132 six-abreast in business class and 2\u20134\u20132 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as fuel tank, flaps, ailerons and spoilers; they are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight. When necessary, the A330-300 ( A330 ) uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power. The A330-300 ( A330 ) shares the same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and the A340, featuring electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330-300 ( A330 ) also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents maneuvers from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.\nAs of December 2017, there are 1,358 examples of all A330-300 ( A330 ) variants in airline service, comprising 619 A330-200s, 38 -200Fs, and 733 -300s. The airline operators are Turkish Airlines (64), Air China (59), Cathay Pacific (58), China Eastern Airlines (50), China Southern Airlines (48), Delta Air Lines (42), and other operators with fewer aircraft. In November 2017, 1,190 are transporting passenger with 106 airlines, with the top 29 operating two-thirds of the fleet, 800 aircraft: 530 -200s and 660 A330-300s, mainly high-gross-weight with 36 original shorter-range A330-300s, half of them built since January 2010. Its average sector is 2,000 nmi (3,700 km) and their longest flight is 6,000 nmi (11,000 km) from Buenos Aires to Rome by Aerolineas Argentinas for the -200, and 5,000 nmi (9,300 km) from Paris to Reunion by Corsair and French Blue for the -300. Of operators of at least five A330s, 17 have ordered A350-900s, 11 have ordered B787-8/9s, 13 both, 3 have ordered A330neos and 2 both A330neos and A350s, and 14 haven't yet decided a replacement.\nLong-haul comfort, this aircraft is serving everybody, everywhere; from the biggest megacities to the smallest dream islands, this aircraft continues to please passengers and airlines alike. As a twin-engine twin-aisle widebody that can carry between 277 to 440 passengers, the A330-300 is flexible enough to offer a range of seating options while consistently delivering high-quality comfort to all those on board. Benefitting from continuous investment over the last 20 years it, incorporates the most modern amenities in comfort and in-flight experience. The spacious and inviting cabin features elegant ambient lighting, comfortable seats that are wider than its rivals and the latest-generation entertainment systems. Its cabin is also one of the quietest in the skies, creating a calm environment for the entire flight. Movies on-demand allow passengers to suit their own personal tastes, while satellite connectivity options can let passengers use mobile phones, internet and email in the air \u2013 allowing them to stay up-to-date with social media, business emails or whatever is happening on the ground.\nContinual improvement, airbus invests 150 million euros annually in the A330-300 ( A330 ) programme to deliver continuous innovation to this jetliner product line, which results in lower costs and better operations for the A330-300. Like all Airbus aircraft, The A330-300 utilises the fly-by-wire digital control system, but also incorporates several new features. These upgrades range from weight reductions in the airframe, introduction of modern passenger cabin features, and system improvements to engine upgrades and advanced navigation systems in the cockpit. They also result in longer maintenance check intervals. A further enhancement of the A330-300 ( A330 ) comes with Airbus\u2019 launch of an increased maximum takeoff weight capability to 242 metric tonnes.  With this improvement, the A330-300 benefits from up to 500 nautical miles of extra range, to 6,350 nautical miles (11,750 km.) with 277 passengers, and carries nearly five tonnes more payload than the previous 235-tonne aircraft. In operational terms, the increased takeoff weight A330-300 can connect to the following new city pairs: London to Tokyo; Frankfurt to Cape Town; Beijing to Melbourne; Beijing to San Francisco; Kuala Lumpur to Paris; and Los Angeles to Dublin. \n\nVariants:\nA330-300:\nPowered by two General Electric CF6-80E1, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, the 63.69 m (208 ft 11 in) long \u2212300 has a range of 11,750 km / 6,350 nmi, typically carries 277 passengers with a 440 exit limit and 32 LD3 containers. It received European and American certification on 21 October 1993 after 420 test flights over 1,100 hours. The \u2212300 entered service on 16 January 1994. The A330-300 is based on a stretched A300 fuselage but with new wings, stabilisers and fly-by-wire systems. In 2010, Airbus offered a new version of the \u2212300 with the maximum gross weight increased by two tonnes to 235 t. This enabled 120 nmi extension of the range as well as 1.2 t increase in payload. In mid-2012, Airbus proposed another increase of the maximum gross weight to 240 t. It is planned to be implemented by mid-2015. This \u2212300 version will have the range extended by 400 nmi and will carry 5 t more payload. It will include engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2%. In November 2012, it was further announced that the gross weight will increase from 235 t to 242 t, and the range will increase by 500 nmi or 926 km or 575 mi to 6,100 nmi (11,300 km; 7,020 mi). Airbus is also planning to activate the central fuel tank for the first time for the \u2212300 model. As of June 2018, 787 -300s had been ordered, 743 of which had been delivered, with 722 in operation. The 2015 list price is $253.7 million. The closest competitors have been the Boeing 777-200/200ER, and the now out-of-production McDonnell Douglas MD-11.\nA330-300HGW:\nIn 2000, it was reported that Airbus was studying an A330-300 version with a higher gross weight. It was named A330-300HGW and had a takeoff weight of 240 tonnes (530,000 lb), 7 tonnes (15,000 lb) greater than the \u2212300's weight at the time. The version would have a strengthened wing and additional fuel capacity from a 41,600-litre (11,000 US gal) centre section fuel tank. The A330-300HGW's range was increased to over 11,000 km (5,940 nmi; 6,840 mi). Among those that showed interest was leasing company ILFC, which sought airliners that could fly from the US West Coast to Europe. Power was to be supplied by all three engines offered to A330-200 and A330-300 with lower gross weight. Airbus also considered using the new Engine Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330-300HGW, which would have been the engine's first twinjet application. The \u2212300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched and quietly disappeared. The 240-tonne A330-300 ( A330 ) reappeared years later when Airbus announced at the 2012 Farnborough Airshow that it would be an available option for both the A330-300 and the A330-200. In November 2012, the maximum take off weight was further increased to 242 tonnes; the first of these aircraft was to enter service with Delta Air Lines in Q2 2015.\nA330-300 ( A330 ) Regional:\nIn September 2013, Airbus announced a version of the A330-300, named A330-300 ( A330 ) Regional or A330-300 Regional. The A330-300 ( A330 ) Regional have seating for up to around 400 passengers, with reduced engine thrust, reduced maximum takeoff weight of 199 t (439,000 lb) and reduced range of 2,700 nautical miles (5,000 km; 3,110 mi). It is said that the maximum takeoff weight of these aircraft is an \"easy upgrade to 242 t (534,000 lb)\", which is the extended range version with range of 6,350 nmi (11,800 km; 7,310 mi). It is said to provide up to 26% lower operating costs than the longer range version A330-300.

Building on the proven success of its popular twin-aisle twin-engine widebody A330-800 ( A330 ) Family, Airbus launched the A330neo jetliner in July 2014, comprised of two aircraft: the A330-800 and the A330-900. The A330-800 is based on the popular A330-200 and delivers significant improvements in terms of efficiency, while also launching the eye-catching Airspace by Airbus cabin that will redefine the quality of in-flight experience passengers can come to expect.

With a range of 7,500 nautical miles, the A330-800 will typically seat 257 passengers in three classes of service, while offering capacity for up to 406 travellers in a high-density configuration.\n\nThe Airbus A330-800 ( A330 ) is a medium- to long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner made by Airbus. Versions of the A330-800 ( A330 ) have a range of 5,000 to 13,430 kilometres (2,700 to 7,250 nmi; 3,110 to 8,350 mi) and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a two-class layout or carry 70 tonnes (154,000 lb) of cargo. The A330's origin dates to the mid-1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus's first airliner, the A300. The A330-800 ( A330 ) was developed in parallel with the four-engine A340, which shared many common airframe components but differed in number of engines. Both airliners incorporated fly-by-wire flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the A320, as well as the A320's six-display glass cockpit. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340. The A330-800 ( A330 ) was Airbus's first airliner that offered a choice of three engine types: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700. The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with Air Inter in January 1994. Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently-developed A330-800 ( A330 ) variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, a military tanker, the A330-800 ( A330 ) MRTT, and a corporate jet, ACJ330. The A330-800 ( A330 ) MRTT formed the basis of the proposed KC-45, entered into the US Air Force's KC-X competition with Northrop Grumman, where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker. Since its launch, the A330-800 ( A330 ) has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide-body airliners. Competing twinjets include the Boeing 767 and 777, along with the 787. The long-range Airbus A350 XWB was planned to succeed both the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340. Airbus intends to replace the current A330-800 ( A330 ) (referred to as the A330ceo (current engine option) since 2014) with the A330neo, which includes new engines and other improvements. As of October 2018, A330-800 ( A330 ) orders stand at 1,733, of which 1,424 have been delivered and 1,388 remain in operation. The largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 65 A330s in its fleet.\nAirbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft. Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects. In the mid-1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300. At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market. To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for \"twin aisle\". Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500 million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.\nThe first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982. They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold\u2014double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and 8.46 metres (27.8 ft) longer than the Airbus A300. By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and side-stick control. Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots. The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week's training, which reduces operator costs. The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections. Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing, a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected. With necessary funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df stated afterwards that \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, now officially designated as the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a \"4\" in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.\nFrom the beginning of the TA9's development, a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, and GE Aviation, was planned. GE Aviation first offered the CF6-80C2. However, later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from 267 to 289 kN (60,000 to 65,000 lbf). GE enlarged the CF6-80C2 fan from 236 to 244 centimetres (92.9 to 96.1 in) and reduced the number of fan blades from 38 to 34 to create the CF6-80E1 with a thrust of 300\u2013320 kN (67,000\u201372,000 lbf). Rolls-Royce initially wanted to use the 267 kN (60,000 lbf) Trent 600 to power Airbus's newest twinjet and the upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330, the Trent 700, with a larger diameter and 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. The A330-800 ( A330 ) became the first Airbus aircraft on which Rolls-Royce supplied engines. Similarly, Pratt & Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330-exclusive PW4168. The company increased the fan size from 94 in (2.39 m) to 100 in (2.54 m), enabling the engine to deliver 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. Like the CF6-80E1, 34 blades were used instead of the 38 found on the smaller PW4000 engines.\nIn preparation for the production of the A330-800 ( A330 ) and the A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In England, BAe made a \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with 15,000 m2 (161,000 sq ft) of floor area at Filton. BAe also spent \u00a35 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant. In Germany, Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm (MBB) invested DM400 million ($225 million) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary, including at Bremen, Einswarden, Varel, and Hamburg. France saw the biggest investments, with A\u00e9rospatiale constructing a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) final-assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Colomiers; by November 1988, the pillars for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall had been erected. The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process. On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. Domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options, while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options. Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330-800 ( A330 ) deliveries to start in 1993. Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March. BAe eventually received \u00a3450 million of funding from the UK government, well short of the \u00a3750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven. The wing-to-fuselage mating of the first A330, the tenth airframe of the A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the problem. At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders. The first completed A330-800 ( A330 ) was rolled out on 14 October 1992, with the maiden flight following on 2 November. Weighing 181,840 kg (401,000 lb), including 20,980 kg (46,300 lb) of test equipment, the A330-800 ( A330 ) became the biggest twinjet to have flown, until the later first flight of the Boeing 777. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours. On 21 October 1993, the Airbus A330-800 ( A330 ) received the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights. At the same time, weight tests came in favourable, showing the plane was 500 kg (1,100 lb) under weight. On 30 June 1994, a fatal crash occurred during certification of the Pratt & Whitney engine when an A330-800 ( A330 ) crashed near Toulouse. Both pilots and the five passengers died. The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one-engine-off worst-case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot, and the aircraft lost speed and crashed. An investigation by an internal branch of Direction Generale d'Aviation concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery. This led to a revision of A330-800 ( A330 ) operating procedures.\nAir Inter became the first operator of the A330, having put the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport, Paris, and Marseille. Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine's thrust reverser assembly. Thai Airways received its first A330-800 ( A330 ) during the second half of the year, operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul. Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994. MAS received its A330-800 ( A330 ) on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders. Airbus intended the A330-800 ( A330 ) to compete in the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the \"ETOPS out of the box\" or \"Early ETOPS\" approach taken by Boeing with its 777,[Nb 1] Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330-800 ( A330 ) using in-service experience. Airbus suggested that the A340 and the A330-800 ( A330 ) were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340's experience could be applied to the A330's ETOPS approval. The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330-800 ( A330 ) fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995.[Nb 2] Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330-800 ( A330 ) became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS\u2013240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.\nInitially, the GE90 was only one of three B777 options, and GE Aviation then-CEO Brian H. Rowe would have paid for the development of putting it on an A330; however, Airbus' strategy for long-haul was the four-engine A340, missing the market favouring twins. In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200. Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER. The plane was aimed at the 11,900 km (6,430 nmi; 7,390 mi) sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015. The project, with US$450 million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995. The A330-200 first flew on 13 August 1997. The sixteen-month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights. The A330-200's first customer was ILFC; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000, who became the type's first operator. As Airbus worked on its A330-200, hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340-200 in January 1994. On 4 January of that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport, was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main undercarriage well. The incident caused US$30 million in damage, and the aircraft took six months to repair. Consequently, operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997. Responding to lagging A300-600F and A310F sales, Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330-200F, a freighter derivative of the A330-200, around 2001. The freighter has a range of 7,400 km (4,000 nmi; 4,600 mi) with a 65 tonnes (140,000 lb) payload, or 5,900 km (3,200 nmi; 3,700 mi) with 70 tonnes (150,000 lb). The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version; however, it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous \"blister fairing\". This raises the aircraft's nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading, as the standard A330's landing gear results the plane having a nose-down attitude while on the ground. The A330-200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009. This marked the start of a four-month, 180-hour certification programme. JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April. The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division, Etihad Cargo, in July 2010.On 25 September 2013 at the Aviation Expo China (Beijing Airshow), Airbus announced a new lower weight A330-300 variant, optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows; China and India were recognised as prime targets. This variant could carry up to 400 passengers. The increased efficiency, however, comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction. On relatively short, yet congested routes, the A330-800 ( A330 ) competes against single-aisle jetliners. While the A330's operating costs in these conditions are not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321, the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency. Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased, using larger aircraft, such as the A330, is the only available option to increase capacity. The first customer for the A330-800 ( A330 ) Regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show.\nThe A330-800 ( A330 ) is a medium-size, wide-body aircraft, with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the airplane on the ground. Its MTOW grew from 212 tonnes (467,000 lb) at introduction to 242 tonnes (534,000 lb) in 2015, enhancing its payload-range performance. John Leahy states that it was intentionally being held down in takeoff weight and performance because Airbus avoided overlapping with the A340. The airframe of the A330-800 ( A330 ) features a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340-200/300. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[Nb 3] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (8.99 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The shared wing design with the A340 allowed the A330-800 ( A330 ) to incorporate aerodynamic features developed for the former aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 \"SuperFan\", which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (180 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (190 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (200 ft). At 60.3 m (200 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747\u2013200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The A330-800 ( A330 ) and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: 5.64 m (19 ft) and 5.26 m (17 ft). Typical seating arrangements are 2\u20132\u20132 six-abreast in business class and 2\u20134\u20132 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as fuel tank, flaps, ailerons and spoilers; they are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight. When necessary, the A330-800 ( A330 ) uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power. The A330-800 ( A330 ) shares the same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and the A340, featuring electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330-800 ( A330 ) also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents maneuvers from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.\nAs of December 2017, there are 1,358 examples of all A330-800 ( A330 ) variants in airline service, comprising 619 A330-200s, 38 -200Fs, and 733 -300s. The airline operators are Turkish Airlines (64), Air China (59), Cathay Pacific (58), China Eastern Airlines (50), China Southern Airlines (48), Delta Air Lines (42), and other operators with fewer aircraft. In November 2017, 1,190 are transporting passenger with 106 airlines, with the top 29 operating two-thirds of the fleet, 800 aircraft: 530 -200s and 660 A330-300s, mainly high-gross-weight with 36 original shorter-range A330-300s, half of them built since January 2010. Its average sector is 2,000 nmi (3,700 km) and their longest flight is 6,000 nmi (11,000 km) from Buenos Aires to Rome by Aerolineas Argentinas for the -200, and 5,000 nmi (9,300 km) from Paris to Reunion by Corsair and French Blue for the -300.

Building on the same dimensions as Airbus' proven A330-300, the A330-900 version makes for an even more efficient and comfortable aircraft.\nBuilding on success, building on the proven success of its popular twin-aisle, twin-engine, widebody A330-900 ( A330 ) Family, Airbus launched the A330neo jetliner \u2013 comprising the A330-800 and A330-900 versions \u2013 in July 2014. The A330neo Family delivers significant efficiency improvements while also launching the Airspace by Airbus cabin, which offers the newest and most advanced in-flight experience.  Incorporating the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, along with aerodynamic improvements \u2013 including new composite Sharklet wingtip devices that provide 3.7 metres of increased wing span \u2013 as well as increased lift and reduced drag, the A330neo is a more efficient aircraft that will generate savings through reduced fuel burn. The longer-fuselage A330-900 version can accommodate 287 seats in a typical three-class layout or up to 440 for high-density configurations, and can provide a range of 7,200 nautical miles. First flight of the A330-900, which occurred in October 2017, kicked off a comprehensive flight test campaign leading up to its Type Certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) less than one year later.

Versions of the A330-900 ( A330 ) have a range of 5,000 to 13,430 kilometres (2,700 to 7,250 nmi; 3,110 to 8,350 mi) and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a two-class layout or carry 70 tonnes (154,000 lb) of cargo. The A330's origin dates to the mid-1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus's first airliner, the A300. The A330-900 ( A330 ) was developed in parallel with the four-engine A340, which shared many common airframe components but differed in number of engines. Both airliners incorporated fly-by-wire flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the A320, as well as the A320's six-display glass cockpit. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340. The A330-900 ( A330 ) was Airbus's first airliner that offered a choice of three engine types: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700. The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with Air Inter in January 1994. Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently-developed A330-900 ( A330 ) variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, a military tanker, the A330-900 ( A330 ) MRTT, and a corporate jet, ACJ330. The A330-900 ( A330 ) MRTT formed the basis of the proposed KC-45, entered into the US Air Force's KC-X competition with Northrop Grumman, where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker. Since its launch, the A330-900 ( A330 ) has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide-body airliners. Competing twinjets include the Boeing 767 and 777, along with the 787. The long-range Airbus A350 XWB was planned to succeed both the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340. Airbus intends to replace the current A330-900 ( A330 ) (referred to as the A330ceo (current engine option) since 2014) with the A330neo, which includes new engines and other improvements. As of October 2018, A330-900 ( A330 ) orders stand at 1,733, of which 1,424 have been delivered and 1,388 remain in operation. The largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 65 A330s in its fleet.\nAirbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft. Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects. In the mid-1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300. At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market. To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for \"twin aisle\". Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500 million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.\nThe first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982. They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold\u2014double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and 8.46 metres (27.8 ft) longer than the Airbus A300. By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and side-stick control. Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots. The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week's training, which reduces operator costs. The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections. Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing, a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected. With necessary funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df stated afterwards that \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, now officially designated as the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a \"4\" in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.\nFrom the beginning of the TA9's development, a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, and GE Aviation, was planned. GE Aviation first offered the CF6-80C2. However, later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from 267 to 289 kN (60,000 to 65,000 lbf). GE enlarged the CF6-80C2 fan from 236 to 244 centimetres (92.9 to 96.1 in) and reduced the number of fan blades from 38 to 34 to create the CF6-80E1 with a thrust of 300\u2013320 kN (67,000\u201372,000 lbf). Rolls-Royce initially wanted to use the 267 kN (60,000 lbf) Trent 600 to power Airbus's newest twinjet and the upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330, the Trent 700, with a larger diameter and 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. The A330-900 ( A330 ) became the first Airbus aircraft on which Rolls-Royce supplied engines. Similarly, Pratt & Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330-exclusive PW4168. The company increased the fan size from 94 in (2.39 m) to 100 in (2.54 m), enabling the engine to deliver 311 kN (69,900 lbf) of thrust. Like the CF6-80E1, 34 blades were used instead of the 38 found on the smaller PW4000 engines.\nIn preparation for the production of the A330-900 ( A330 ) and the A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In England, BAe made a \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with 15,000 m2 (161,000 sq ft) of floor area at Filton. BAe also spent \u00a35 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant. In Germany, Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm (MBB) invested DM400 million ($225 million) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary, including at Bremen, Einswarden, Varel, and Hamburg. France saw the biggest investments, with A\u00e9rospatiale constructing a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) final-assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Colomiers; by November 1988, the pillars for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall had been erected. The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process. On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. Domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options, while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options. Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330-900 ( A330 ) deliveries to start in 1993. Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March. BAe eventually received \u00a3450 million of funding from the UK government, well short of the \u00a3750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven. The wing-to-fuselage mating of the first A330, the tenth airframe of the A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the problem. At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders. The first completed A330-900 ( A330 ) was rolled out on 14 October 1992, with the maiden flight following on 2 November. Weighing 181,840 kg (401,000 lb), including 20,980 kg (46,300 lb) of test equipment, the A330-900 ( A330 ) became the biggest twinjet to have flown, until the later first flight of the Boeing 777. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours. On 21 October 1993, the Airbus A330-900 ( A330 ) received the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights. At the same time, weight tests came in favourable, showing the plane was 500 kg (1,100 lb) under weight. On 30 June 1994, a fatal crash occurred during certification of the Pratt & Whitney engine when an A330-900 ( A330 ) crashed near Toulouse. Both pilots and the five passengers died. The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one-engine-off worst-case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot, and the aircraft lost speed and crashed. An investigation by an internal branch of Direction Generale d'Aviation concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery. This led to a revision of A330-900 ( A330 ) operating procedures.\nAir Inter became the first operator of the A330, having put the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport, Paris, and Marseille. Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine's thrust reverser assembly. Thai Airways received its first A330-900 ( A330 ) during the second half of the year, operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul. Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994. MAS received its A330-900 ( A330 ) on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders. Airbus intended the A330-900 ( A330 ) to compete in the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the \"ETOPS out of the box\" or \"Early ETOPS\" approach taken by Boeing with its 777,[Nb 1] Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330-900 ( A330 ) using in-service experience. Airbus suggested that the A340 and the A330-900 ( A330 ) were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340's experience could be applied to the A330's ETOPS approval. The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330-900 ( A330 ) fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995.[Nb 2] Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330-900 ( A330 ) became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS\u2013240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.\nInitially, the GE90 was only one of three B777 options, and GE Aviation then-CEO Brian H. Rowe would have paid for the development of putting it on an A330; however, Airbus' strategy for long-haul was the four-engine A340, missing the market favouring twins. In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200. Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER. The plane was aimed at the 11,900 km (6,430 nmi; 7,390 mi) sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015. The project, with US$450 million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995. The A330-200 first flew on 13 August 1997. The sixteen-month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights. The A330-200's first customer was ILFC; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000, who became the type's first operator. As Airbus worked on its A330-200, hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340-200 in January 1994. On 4 January of that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport, was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main undercarriage well. The incident caused US$30 million in damage, and the aircraft took six months to repair. Consequently, operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997. Responding to lagging A300-600F and A310F sales, Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330-200F, a freighter derivative of the A330-200, around 2001. The freighter has a range of 7,400 km (4,000 nmi; 4,600 mi) with a 65 tonnes (140,000 lb) payload, or 5,900 km (3,200 nmi; 3,700 mi) with 70 tonnes (150,000 lb). The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version; however, it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous \"blister fairing\". This raises the aircraft's nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading, as the standard A330's landing gear results the plane having a nose-down attitude while on the ground. The A330-200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009. This marked the start of a four-month, 180-hour certification programme. JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April. The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division, Etihad Cargo, in July 2010.On 25 September 2013 at the Aviation Expo China (Beijing Airshow), Airbus announced a new lower weight A330-300 variant, optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows; China and India were recognised as prime targets. This variant could carry up to 400 passengers. The increased efficiency, however, comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction. On relatively short, yet congested routes, the A330-900 ( A330 ) competes against single-aisle jetliners. While the A330's operating costs in these conditions are not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321, the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency. Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased, using larger aircraft, such as the A330, is the only available option to increase capacity. The first customer for the A330-900 ( A330 ) Regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show.\nThe A330-900 ( A330 ) is a medium-size, wide-body aircraft, with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the airplane on the ground. Its MTOW grew from 212 tonnes (467,000 lb) at introduction to 242 tonnes (534,000 lb) in 2015, enhancing its payload-range performance. John Leahy states that it was intentionally being held down in takeoff weight and performance because Airbus avoided overlapping with the A340. The airframe of the A330-900 ( A330 ) features a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340-200/300. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[Nb 3] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (8.99 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The shared wing design with the A340 allowed the A330-900 ( A330 ) to incorporate aerodynamic features developed for the former aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 \"SuperFan\", which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (180 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (190 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (200 ft). At 60.3 m (200 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747\u2013200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The A330-900 ( A330 ) and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: 5.64 m (19 ft) and 5.26 m (17 ft). Typical seating arrangements are 2\u20132\u20132 six-abreast in business class and 2\u20134\u20132 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as fuel tank, flaps, ailerons and spoilers; they are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight. When necessary, the A330-900 ( A330 ) uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power. The A330-900 ( A330 ) shares the same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and the A340, featuring electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330-900 ( A330 ) also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents maneuvers from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.\nAs of December 2017, there are 1,358 examples of all A330-900 ( A330 ) variants in airline service, comprising 619 A330-200s, 38 -200Fs, and 733 -300s. The airline operators are Turkish Airlines (64), Air China (59), Cathay Pacific (58), China Eastern Airlines (50), China Southern Airlines (48), Delta Air Lines (42), and other operators with fewer aircraft. In November 2017, 1,190 are transporting passenger with 106 airlines, with the top 29 operating two-thirds of the fleet, 800 aircraft: 530 -200s and 660 A330-300s, mainly high-gross-weight with 36 original shorter-range A330-300s, half of them built since January 2010. Its average sector is 2,000 nmi (3,700 km) and their longest flight is 6,000 nmi (11,000 km) from Buenos Aires to Rome by Aerolineas Argentinas for the -200, and 5,000 nmi (9,300 km) from Paris to Reunion by Corsair and French Blue for the -300.

This is the shortest version of the family and the only version with a wingspan measuring greater than its fuselage length. It is powered by four CFMI CFM56-5C4 engines and uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350[A] auxiliary power unit (APU). It initially entered service with Air France in May 1993. Due to its large wingspan, four engines, low capacity and improvements to the larger A340-300, the -200 proved heavy and unpopular with mainstream airlines. Only 28 A340-200s were produced. The closest Boeing competitor is the Boeing 767-400ER. One version of this type (referred to by Airbus as the A340-8000) was ordered by the prince Jefri Bolkiah requesting a non-stop range of 15,000 kilometres (8,100 nmi). This A340-8000, in the Royal Brunei Airlines livery had an increased fuel capacity, an MTOW of 275 tonnes (606,000 lb), similar to the A340-300, and minor reinforcements to the undercarriage. It is powered by the 150 kilonewtons (34,000 lbf) thrust CFM56-5C4s similar to the -300E. Only one A340-8000 was produced. Besides the -8000, some A340-200s are used for VIP or military use; users include Royal Brunei Airlines, Qatar Amiri Flight, Arab Republic of Egypt Government, Royal Saudi Air Force, Jordan and the French Air Force. Following the -8000, other A340-200s were later given performance improvement packages (PIPs) that helped them achieve similar gains in capability as to the A340-8000. Those aircraft are labeled A340-213X. The range for this version is 15,000 kilometres (8,100 nmi). The final airline example of the A340-200 was retired by Air Leisure in July 2017. All active remaining A340-200s still flying after July 2017 are VIP or government planes.\n\nThe Airbus A340-200 ( A340 )is a long-range, four-engine, wide-body commercial passenger jet airliner that was developed and produced by the European aerospace company Airbus. The A340-200 ( A340 )was assembled in Toulouse, France. It seats up to 375 passengers in the standard variants and 440 in the stretched -600 series. Depending on the model, it has a range of 6,700 to 9,000 nautical miles (12,400 to 16,700 km; 7,700 to 10,400 mi). Its distinguishing features are four high-bypass turbofan engines and three-bogie main landing gear. The A340-200 ( A340 )was manufactured in four fuselage lengths. The initial variant, A340-300, which entered service in 1993, measured 63.69 metres (209.0 ft). The shorter -200 was developed next, and the A340-600 was a 15.96 metres (52.4 ft) stretch of the -200. The -600 was developed alongside the shorter A340-500, which would become the longest-range commercial airliner until the arrival of the Boeing 777-200LR. The -200 and -300 models were powered by the 151 kilonewtons (34,000 lbf) CFM56-5C, while the 267-kilonewton (60,000 lbf) Rolls-Royce Trent 500 was the exclusive powerplant for the extended-range -500 and -600 models. The initial A340-200 and -300 variants share the fuselage and wing of the twin-engine Airbus A330 with which it was concurrently designed. The heavier A340-500 and -600 are stretched and have enlarged wings. Launch customers Lufthansa and Air France placed the A340-200 ( A340 )into service in March 1993. In September 2011, 379 orders had been placed (not including private operators), of which 375 were delivered. The most common type were the A340-300 model, with 218 aircraft delivered. Lufthansa is the biggest operator of the A340, having acquired 59 aircraft. The A340-200 ( A340 )is used on long-haul, trans-oceanic routes due to its immunity from ETOPS restrictions; however, with reliability and fuel efficiency in engines improving, airlines have gradually phased out the type in favour of more economical twinjets of comparable capacity such as the Boeing 777, while Airbus has positioned the larger variants of the Airbus A350 as a successor. Airbus announced on 10 November 2011 that A340-200 ( A340 )production had been concluded.\nWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the Airbus A320 family, which was the first digital fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus. As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 in the single-aisle, narrow-body airliner market, Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market. The A300B11, a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" engines. It would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km). It was deemed the replacement for the less-efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s still in service. The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engine at the time. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. The B9 would offer the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, but would use between 25% to 38% less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered the replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. To differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for \"twin aisle\"), respectively. In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same wing and airframe; the projected savings were estimated at US$500 million (about \u00a3490 million or \u20ac495 million). The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled, North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982. While the TA9 had a range of 3,300 nautical miles (6,100 km), the TA11 range was up to 6,830 nautical miles (12,650 km). At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) lesser range. By the time of the Paris Air Show in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system and side-stick control. Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training. The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310. Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs. Airbus briefly considered a variable camber wing; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe) at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency. However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development. Airbus had held discussions with McDonnell Douglas to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the AM 300. This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its trijet heritage. Although from the start it was intended that the A340-200 ( A340 )would be powered by four CFM56-5 turbofan engines, each capable of 25,000 pounds-force (110 kN), Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the Rolls-Royce RB211-535 and Pratt & Whitney JT10D-232 (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980). As refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engines Corporation, Fiat and MTU Aero Engines (MTU). The engine nacelles of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the CFM56-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 500 engines. On 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in Munich, West Germany, after which board-chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a two-engine jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including Lufthansa and Swissair. \nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. Filton was the site of BAE's \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor area. BAe also spent \u00a35 million expanding the Chester wing production plant by 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with A\u00e9rospatiale starting construction of a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) assembly plant, adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, in Colomiers. By November 1988, the first 21 m (69 ft) pillars were erected for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall. The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots. The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time. British Aerospace accepted \u00a3450 million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750 million originally requested. Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter. Airbus also issued subcontracts to companies in Austria, Australia, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. The A330 and A340-200 ( A340 )programmes were jointly launched on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. The order book then stood at 130 aircraft from 10 customers, apart from the above-mentioned Lufthansa and International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Eighty-nine of the total orders were A340-200 ( A340 )models. At McDonnell Douglas, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important carrier, Singapore Airlines (SIA), required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter in the northern hemisphere. The MD-11, according to test results, would experience fuel starvation over the Balkans. Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, SIA cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on 2 August 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead. Despite selling 200 units, some[weasel words] consider that the MD-11 failed commercially and that it unsuccessfully competed against the A340. The first flight of the A340-200 ( A340 )occurred on 21 October 1991, marking the start of a 2,000-hour test flight programme involving six aircraft. From the start, engineers noticed that the wings were not stiff enough to carry the outboard engines at cruising speed without warping and fluttering. To alleviate this, an underwing bulge called a plastron was developed to correct airflow problems around the engine pylons and to add stiffness. European JAA certification was obtained on 22 December 1992; the FAA followed on 27 May 1993.\nThe first A340, a -200, was delivered to Lufthansa on 2 February 1993 and entered service on 15 March. The 228-seat airliner was named N\u00fcrnberg. The first A340-300, the 1000th Airbus, was delivered to Air France on 26 February, the first of nine it planned to operate by the end of the year. Air France replaced the Boeing 747 with the A340-200 ( A340 )on Paris\u2013Washington D.C., flying four times weekly. Lufthansa intended to replace aging DC-10s with the A340s on Frankfurt\u2013New York services. On 16 June 1993, an A340-200 dubbed the World Ranger flew from the Paris Air Show to Auckland, New Zealand in 21 hours 32 minutes and back in 21 hours 46 minutes after a five-hour stop; this was the first non-stop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest non-stop flight by an airliner at the time. The 19,277 km (10,409 nmi) flight from Paris to Auckland broke six world records with 22 persons and five center tanks.  Taking off at 11:58 local time, it arrived back in Paris 48 hours and 22 minutes later, at 12:20. This record held until 1997 when a Boeing 777-200ER flew 20,044 km (10,823 nmi) from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur.\nIn 1991, the A340-400X was a simple 12-frame, 20 ft 10 in (6.35 m) -300 stretch from 295 to 335 passengers with the MTOW bumped from 553,360 to 588,600 lb (251 to 267 t) and the range decreased by 750 to 5,900 nmi (1,390 to 10,930 km). CFM International was then set to develop for $1\u20131.5 billion a new engine between the 150 kN (34,000 lbf) CFM56 and the 315\u2013400 kN (70\u201390,000 lbf) GE90. In 1994, Airbus was studying a heavier A340-200 ( A340 )Advanced with a reinforced wing and 178 kN (40,000 lbf) engines: the Pratt & Whitney advanced ducted propulsor, CFM International CFMXX or Rolls Royce RB.411, to allow from 1996 a -300 stretch for 50 more passengers over the same range, a -300 with the -200 range and a -200 with more range. In 1995, the A340-400 was slated for 2000, seating 380 passengers with a 300 t (660,000 lb) take-off weight. In April 1996, GE Aviation obtained an exclusivity for the 13,000 km (7,000 nmi) 375-passenger -600 stretch with 226 kN (51,000 lbf) engines, above the 225.5 kN (50,700 lbf) limit of the CFM International partnership with SNECMA and dropping the 191 kN (43,000 lbf) CFMXX. The -600 would be stretched by 20\u201322 frames to 75 m (246 ft), unit thrust was raised from 227 kN (51,000 lbf) to 249 kN (56,000 lbf) and maximum takeoff weight would be increased to 330 t (730,000 lb). The wing area would increase by 56m\u00b2 (600 ft\u00b2) to 420 m2 (4,500 sq ft) through a larger chord needing a three-frame centre fuselage insert and retaining the existing front and rear spars, and a span increased by 3.5 to 63.8 m (11 to 209 ft), along a 25% increase in wing fuel capacity and four wheels replacing the centre twin bogie. A -500 with the larger wing and engines and three extra frames for 310 passengers would cover 15,725 km (8,490 nmi) to replace the smaller, 14,800 km (8,000 nmi) range, A340-8000. At least $1 billion would be needed to develop the airframe, excluding $2 billion for the engine development supported by the its manufacturer. A 12 frame -400 simple stretch would cover 11,290 km (6,100 nmi) with 340 passengers in three-class. It was enlarged by 40% to compete with the then in-development 777-300ER/200LR: the wing would be expanded with a tapered wing box insert along the span extension, it would have enlarged horizontal stabilizers and the larger A330-200 fin and it would need 222\u2013267 kN (50\u201360,000 lbf) of unit thrust. The ultra-long-haul 1.53 m (5.0 ft) -500 stretch would seat 316 passengers, a little more than the -300, over 15,355 km (8,290 nmi), while the 10.07 m (33.0 ft) -600 stretch would offer a 25% larger cabin for 372 passengers over a range of 7,400 nmi (13,700 km). MTOW was increased to 356 t (785,000 lb). Unwilling to commit to a $1 Billion development without a good return on investment prospects and a second application, in 1997 GE Aviation stopped exclusivity talks for a scaled down GE90 to 245\u2013290 kN (55\u201365,000 lbf), leaving Rolls-Royce Plc proposing a more cost-effective Rolls-Royce Trent variant needing less development and Pratt & Whitney: a PW2000 advanced ducted propulsor, a PW4000 derivative or a new geared turbofan. In June 1997, the 250 kN (56,000 lbf) Trent 500 was selected, with growth potential to 275 kN (62,000 lbf), derived from the A330 Trent 700 and the B777 Trent 800 with a reduced fan diameter and a new LP turbine, for a 7.7% lower TSFC than the 700. Airbus claims 10% lower operating costs per seat than the -300, 3% below those of the B777-3000ER. The $2.9 billion program was launched in December 1997 with 100 commitments from seven customers worth $3 billion, aiming to fly the first -600 in January 2001 and deliver it from early 2002 to capture at least half of the 1,500 sales forecast in the category through 2010. In 1998, the -600 stretch was stabilised at 20 frames for 10.6 m (35 ft), the MTOW rose to 365 t (805,000 lb) and the unit thrust to 52,000 to 60,000 lbf (230 to 270 kN), keeping the Trent 700 2.47 m (8.1 ft) fan diameter with its scaled IP and HP compressors and the high-speed, low-loading HP and IP turbines of the Trent 800. Despite the -500/600 introduction, sales slowed in the 2000s as the Boeing 777-200LR/-300ER dominated the long-range 300-400 seats market. The A340-500IGW/600HGW high gross weight variants did not arouse much sales interest. In January 2006, Airbus confirmed it studied an A340-600E (Enhanced), more fuel-efficient than earlier A340s, closing the 8\u20139% disparity with the Boeing 777 with new Trent 1500 engines and technologies from the A350 initial design. Besides lacking twinjet economy, the -600 was immature at service entry and had a high empty weight needing MTOW increases while the B777-300ER was a worthy competitor with a larger fuselage diameter, meeting design specs and being mature on service entry. At 380, the advertised three-class seating of the -600 was well above the real world average of 323 seats, while the B777-300ER is advertised for 365 and offers 332, impacting seat costs. By 2018, a 2006 -600 was worth $18M and a 2003 one $10M, projected to fall to $7M in 2021 with a $200,000/month lease rate falling to $180,000 in 2021; its D check cost $4.5M and its engine overhaul $3-6M.\nIn 2005, 155 B777s were ordered against 15 A340s: twin engine ETOPS restrictions were overcome by lower operating costs, compared to quad jets. In 2007, Airbus predicted that another 127 A340-200 ( A340 )aircraft would likely be produced through 2016, the projected end of production. On 10 November 2011, Airbus announced the end of the A340-200 ( A340 )program. At that time, the company indicated that all firm orders had been delivered. The decision to terminate the program came as A340-500/600 orders came to a halt, with analyst Nick Cunningham pointing out that the A340-200 ( A340 )\"was too heavy and there was a big fuel burn gap between the A340-200 ( A340 )and Boeing\u2019s 777\". Bertrand Grabowski, managing director of aircraft financier DVB Bank SE, noted \"in an environment where the fuel price is high, the A340-200 ( A340 )has had no chance to compete against similar twin engines, and the current lease rates and values of this aircraft reflect the deep resistance of any airlines to continue operating it\u201d. As a sales incentive amid low customer demand during the Great Recession, Airbus had offered buy-back guarantees to airlines that chose to procure the A340. By 2013, the resale value of an A340-200 ( A340 )declined by 30% over ten years, and both Airbus and Rolls-Royce were incurring related charges amounting to hundreds of millions of euros. Some analysts have expected the price of a flight-worthy, CFM56-powered A340-200 ( A340 )to drop below $10 million by 2023. Airbus could offer used A340s to airlines wishing to retire older aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, claiming that the cost of purchasing and maintaining a second-hand A340-200 ( A340 )with increased seating and improved engine performance reportedly compared favourably to the procurement costs of a new Boeing 777. In 2013, as ultra-long range is a niche, the A340-200 ( A340 )was less attractive with best usage on long, thin routes, from hot-and-high airports or as interim air charter. A 10 year old A340-300 had a base value of $35m and a market value of $24m, leading to $320,000/mo ($240,000-$350,000) lease rate, while a -500 is $425,000 and a -600 is leased $450,000 to $500,000 per month, versus $1.3m for a 777-300ER. The lighter A340-300 consumes 5% less fuel per trip with 300 passengers than the 312 passengers 777-200ER while the heavier A340-600 uses 12% more fuel than a 777-300ER. As an effort to support the A340's resale value, Airbus has proposed reconfiguring the aircraft's interior for a single class of 475 seats. As the Trent 500 engines are half the maintenance cost of the A340, Rolls-Royce proposed a cost-reducing maintenance plan similar to the company's existing program that reduced the cost of maintaining the RB211 engine powering Iberia's Boeing 757 freighters. Key to these programs is the salvaging, repair and reuse of serviceable parts from retired older engines. Airbus has positioned the larger versions of the A350, specifically the A350-900 and A350-1000, as the successors to the A340-500 and A340-600. The ACJ340 is listed on the Airbus Corporate Jets website, as Airbus can convert retired A340-200 ( A340 )airliners to VIP transport configuration.\nThe Airbus A340-200 ( A340 )is a wide-body twin-aisle passenger airliner which has the distinction of being the first truly long-range aircraft to be produced by Airbus. It is powered by four FADEC turbofan jet engines, optimized to perform long distance routes. The A340-200 ( A340 )had been built upon developments made in the production of earlier Airbus aircraft and as such shares many features with those aircraft, such as a common cockpit design with the Airbus A320 and A330; as the aircraft was developed at the same time as the A330, the two aircraft employ many similar components and sections, such as identical fly-by-wire control systems and similar wings. Both before and after the A340-200 ( A340 )entered revenue service, the features and improvements developed were usually shared with the A330. The A340-200 ( A340 )is a low-wing cantilever monoplane; for the A340-200 and A340-300 variants, the wing itself is virtually identical to that of the A330. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used. The A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing; also, the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW to carry more fuel for greater range. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[a] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (9.0 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 SuperFan, which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (184 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (192 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (198 ft). At 60.3 m (198 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The flight deck of the A340-200 ( A340 )is a glass cockpit, based upon the control systems first used on the smaller A320. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls. The main instrument panel is dominated by six cathode ray tube monitors which display information to the flight crew; on later aircraft, these monitors have been replaced by liquid crystal displays. Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). The aircraft monitoring system is connected to various sensors throughout the aircraft and automatically alerts the crew to any parameters detected outside of their normal range; pilots can also manually inspect systems of their choosing at any time. The information display system is designed to be easily interpreted and give a clear picture of the aircraft's operational status. Instead of paper manuals, electronic CD-ROM-based manuals are used; Airbus offers web-based updates to electronic documentation as an option. Many measures were taken from the start of the A340's design process to reduce the difficulty and cost of maintenance, which was reportedly half of that of the earlier Airbus A310 despite the increase in size. The aircraft's four engines featured improved controls and monitoring systems that enabled engine parameters to be more readily checked and avoid unnecessary early removals; the four-engine approach also avoided the stringent ETOPS requirements such as more frequent inspections. The A340-200 ( A340 )also has a centralised maintenance computer which provides comprehensive easily understandable systems information, which can be transmitted in real-time to ground facilities via the onboard satellite-based ACARS datalink. Some aspects of the maintenance, such as structural changes, remained unchanged, while increased sophistication of technology in the passenger cabin, like the in-flight entertainment systems, were increased over preceding airliners.\nThe first variant of the A340-200 ( A340 )to be introduced, the A340-200, entered service with the launch customer, Lufthansa, in 1993. It was followed shortly thereafter by the A340-300 with its operator, Air France. Lufthansa's first A340, which had been dubbed N\u00fcrnberg (D-AIBA), began revenue service on 15 March 1993. Air Lanka (later renamed Sri Lankan Airlines) became the Asian launch customer of the Airbus A340; the airline received its first A340-300, registered (4R-ADA), in September 1994. British airline Virgin Atlantic was an early adopter of the A340; in addition to operating several A340-300 aircraft, Virgin Atlantic announced in August 1997 that it was to be the worldwide launch customer for the new A340-600. The first commercial flight of the A340-600 was performed by Virgin in July 2002. Singapore Airlines ordered 17 A340-300s and operated them until October 2013. The A340-300s were purchased by Boeing as part of an order for Boeing 777s in 1999. The airline then purchased five long-range A340-500s, which joined the fleet in December 2003. In February 2004, the airline's A340-500 performed the longest non-stop commercial air service in the world, conducting a non-stop flight between Singapore and Los Angeles. In 2004, Singapore Airlines launched an even longer non-stop route using the A340-500 between Newark and Singapore, SQ 21, a 15,344 kilometres (8,285 nmi) journey that was the longest scheduled non-stop commercial flight in the world. The airline continued to operate this route regularly until the airline decided to retire the type in favour of new A380 and A350 aircraft; its last A340-200 ( A340 )flight was performed in late 2013. The A340-200 ( A340 )was typically used by airlines as a medium-sized long-haul aircraft, and was often a replacement for older Boeing 747s as it was more likely profitable. Airbus produced a number of A340s as large private jets for VIP customers, often to replace aging Boeing 747s in this same role. In 2008, Airbus launched a dedicated corporate jetliner version of the A340-200: one key selling point of this aircraft was a range of up to 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km). Airbus had built up to nine different customized versions of the A340-200 ( A340 )to private customer's specific demands prior to 2008. The A340-200 ( A340 )has frequently been operated as a dedicated transport for heads of state. A pair of A340-300s were acquired from Lufthansa by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force; they serve as VIP transports for the German Chancellor and other key members of the German government. The A340-200 ( A340 )is also operated by the air transport division of the French Air Force, where it is used as a strategic transport for troop deployments and supply missions, as well as to transport government officials. A one-of-a-kind aircraft, the A340-8000, was originally built for Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah. The aircraft was unused and stored in Hamburg until it was procured by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of the House of Saud, and later sold to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, then-President of Libya; the aircraft was operated by Afriqiyah Airways and was often referred to as Afriqiyah One. In 2008, jet fuel prices doubled compared to the year before; consequently, the A340's fuel consumption led airlines to reduce flight stages exceeding 15 hours. Thai Airways International cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's fuel fraction just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, Air France-KLM SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340-200 ( A340 )as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\". While Thai Airways consistently filled 80% of the seats on its New York City\u2013Bangkok flights, it estimated that, at 2008 fuel prices, it would need an impossible 120% of seats filled just to break even. Other airlines also re-examined long-haul flights. In August 2008 Cathay Pacific stated that rising fuel costs were hurting its trans-Pacific long-haul routes disproportionately, and that it would cut the number of such flights and redeploy its aircraft to shorter routes such as between Hong Kong and Australia. \"We will ... reshap[e] our network where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money.\" Aviation Week noted that rapid performance increases of twin-engine aircraft has led to the detriment of four-engine types of comparable capacity such as the A340-200 ( A340 )and 747; at this point most 747s had accumulated significant flying hours before retirement in contrast to A340s which were relatively young when grounded. By 2014, Singapore Airlines had phased out the type, discontinuing SQ21 and SQ22, which had been the longest non-stop scheduled flights in the world. Emirates Airlines decided to accelerate the retirement of its A340-200 ( A340 )fleet, writing down the value of the A340-500 type to zero despite the oldest -500 only being 10 years old, with president Tim Clark saying they \"designed in the late 1990s with fuel at $25-30. They fell over at $60 and at $120 they haven\u2019t got a hope in hell\". International Airlines Group, the parent of Iberia Airlines (which is also the operator of the last production A340-200 ( A340 )built), is overhauling its A340-600s for continued service for the foreseeable future, while it is retiring its A340-300s. The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. Lufthansa, which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340-200 ( A340 )more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue. In 2013, Snecma announced that they planned to use the A340-200 ( A340 )as a flying testbed for the development of a new open rotor engine. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines. The engine, partly based on the Snecma M88 turbofan engine used on the Dassault Rafale, is being developed under the European Clean Sky research initiative.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A340 - Two.\nSeating in A340 - 261 (3-class)  or 303 (30F + 273Y).\nExit limit in A340 - 420/375.\nLength in A340 - 59.39 m / 194.85 ft.\nWingspan in A340 - 60.3 m / 197.83 ft.\nWing in A340 - 363.1 m2 (3,908 sq ft), 29.7\u00b0 sweep, 10 AR.\nHeight in A340 - 17.03 m / 55.86 ft.\nFuselage in A340 - 5.287 m / 208.15 in cabin width, 5.64 m / 18.5 ft outside width.\nCargo volume in A340 - 158.4 m3 (5,590 cu ft).\nMTOW in A340 - 275 t (606,000 lb).\nMax.

This is the initial version, having flown on 25 October 1991, and entered service with Lufthansa and Air France in March 1993. It is powered by four CFMI CFM56-5C engines and uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350[A] APU, similar to the -200. The A340-300 will be superseded by the A350-900. Its closest competitor is the Boeing 777-200ER. A total of 218 -300s were delivered. The A340-300E, often mislabelled as A340-300X, has an increased MTOW of up to 275 tonnes (606,000 lb) and is powered by the more powerful 34,000 lbf (150 kN) thrust CFMI CFM56-5C4 engines. Typical range with 295 passengers is between 7,200 to 7,400 nautical miles (13,300 to 13,700 km). The largest operator of this type is Lufthansa, who has operated a fleet of 30 aircraft. The A340-300 Enhanced is the latest version of this model and was first delivered to South African Airways in 2003, with Air Mauritius receiving the A340-300 Enhanced into its fleet in 2006. It received newer CFM56-5C4/P engines and improved avionics and fly-by-wire systems developed for the A340-500 and -600. As of July 2018, there were 96 Airbus A340-300s in airline service.\n\nThe Airbus A340-300 ( A340 )is a long-range, four-engine, wide-body commercial passenger jet airliner that was developed and produced by the European aerospace company Airbus. The A340-300 ( A340 )was assembled in Toulouse, France. It seats up to 375 passengers in the standard variants and 440 in the stretched -600 series. Depending on the model, it has a range of 6,700 to 9,000 nautical miles (12,400 to 16,700 km; 7,700 to 10,400 mi). Its distinguishing features are four high-bypass turbofan engines and three-bogie main landing gear. The A340-300 ( A340 )was manufactured in four fuselage lengths. The initial variant, A340-300, which entered service in 1993, measured 63.69 metres (209.0 ft). The shorter -200 was developed next, and the A340-600 was a 15.96 metres (52.4 ft) stretch of the -200. The -600 was developed alongside the shorter A340-500, which would become the longest-range commercial airliner until the arrival of the Boeing 777-200LR. The -200 and -300 models were powered by the 151 kilonewtons (34,000 lbf) CFM56-5C, while the 267-kilonewton (60,000 lbf) Rolls-Royce Trent 500 was the exclusive powerplant for the extended-range -500 and -600 models. The initial A340-200 and -300 variants share the fuselage and wing of the twin-engine Airbus A330 with which it was concurrently designed. The heavier A340-500 and -600 are stretched and have enlarged wings. Launch customers Lufthansa and Air France placed the A340-300 ( A340 )into service in March 1993. In September 2011, 379 orders had been placed (not including private operators), of which 375 were delivered. The most common type were the A340-300 model, with 218 aircraft delivered. Lufthansa is the biggest operator of the A340, having acquired 59 aircraft. The A340-300 ( A340 )is used on long-haul, trans-oceanic routes due to its immunity from ETOPS restrictions; however, with reliability and fuel efficiency in engines improving, airlines have gradually phased out the type in favour of more economical twinjets of comparable capacity such as the Boeing 777, while Airbus has positioned the larger variants of the Airbus A350 as a successor. Airbus announced on 10 November 2011 that A340-300 ( A340 )production had been concluded.\nWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the Airbus A320 family, which was the first digital fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus. As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 in the single-aisle, narrow-body airliner market, Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market. The A300B11, a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" engines. It would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km). It was deemed the replacement for the less-efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s still in service. The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engine at the time. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. The B9 would offer the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, but would use between 25% to 38% less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered the replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. To differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for \"twin aisle\"), respectively. In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same wing and airframe; the projected savings were estimated at US$500 million (about \u00a3490 million or \u20ac495 million). The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled, North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982. While the TA9 had a range of 3,300 nautical miles (6,100 km), the TA11 range was up to 6,830 nautical miles (12,650 km). At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) lesser range. By the time of the Paris Air Show in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system and side-stick control. Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training. The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310. Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs. Airbus briefly considered a variable camber wing; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe) at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency. However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development. Airbus had held discussions with McDonnell Douglas to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the AM 300. This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its trijet heritage. Although from the start it was intended that the A340-300 ( A340 )would be powered by four CFM56-5 turbofan engines, each capable of 25,000 pounds-force (110 kN), Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the Rolls-Royce RB211-535 and Pratt & Whitney JT10D-232 (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980). As refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engines Corporation, Fiat and MTU Aero Engines (MTU). The engine nacelles of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the CFM56-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 500 engines. On 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in Munich, West Germany, after which board-chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a two-engine jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including Lufthansa and Swissair. \nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. Filton was the site of BAE's \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor area. BAe also spent \u00a35 million expanding the Chester wing production plant by 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with A\u00e9rospatiale starting construction of a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) assembly plant, adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, in Colomiers. By November 1988, the first 21 m (69 ft) pillars were erected for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall. The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots. The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time. British Aerospace accepted \u00a3450 million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750 million originally requested. Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter. Airbus also issued subcontracts to companies in Austria, Australia, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. The A330 and A340-300 ( A340 )programmes were jointly launched on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. The order book then stood at 130 aircraft from 10 customers, apart from the above-mentioned Lufthansa and International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Eighty-nine of the total orders were A340-300 ( A340 )models. At McDonnell Douglas, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important carrier, Singapore Airlines (SIA), required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter in the northern hemisphere. The MD-11, according to test results, would experience fuel starvation over the Balkans. Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, SIA cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on 2 August 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead. Despite selling 200 units, some[weasel words] consider that the MD-11 failed commercially and that it unsuccessfully competed against the A340. The first flight of the A340-300 ( A340 )occurred on 21 October 1991, marking the start of a 2,000-hour test flight programme involving six aircraft. From the start, engineers noticed that the wings were not stiff enough to carry the outboard engines at cruising speed without warping and fluttering. To alleviate this, an underwing bulge called a plastron was developed to correct airflow problems around the engine pylons and to add stiffness. European JAA certification was obtained on 22 December 1992; the FAA followed on 27 May 1993.\nThe first A340, a -200, was delivered to Lufthansa on 2 February 1993 and entered service on 15 March. The 228-seat airliner was named N\u00fcrnberg. The first A340-300, the 1000th Airbus, was delivered to Air France on 26 February, the first of nine it planned to operate by the end of the year. Air France replaced the Boeing 747 with the A340-300 ( A340 )on Paris\u2013Washington D.C., flying four times weekly. Lufthansa intended to replace aging DC-10s with the A340s on Frankfurt\u2013New York services. On 16 June 1993, an A340-200 dubbed the World Ranger flew from the Paris Air Show to Auckland, New Zealand in 21 hours 32 minutes and back in 21 hours 46 minutes after a five-hour stop; this was the first non-stop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest non-stop flight by an airliner at the time. The 19,277 km (10,409 nmi) flight from Paris to Auckland broke six world records with 22 persons and five center tanks.  Taking off at 11:58 local time, it arrived back in Paris 48 hours and 22 minutes later, at 12:20. This record held until 1997 when a Boeing 777-200ER flew 20,044 km (10,823 nmi) from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur.\nIn 1991, the A340-400X was a simple 12-frame, 20 ft 10 in (6.35 m) -300 stretch from 295 to 335 passengers with the MTOW bumped from 553,360 to 588,600 lb (251 to 267 t) and the range decreased by 750 to 5,900 nmi (1,390 to 10,930 km). CFM International was then set to develop for $1\u20131.5 billion a new engine between the 150 kN (34,000 lbf) CFM56 and the 315\u2013400 kN (70\u201390,000 lbf) GE90. In 1994, Airbus was studying a heavier A340-300 ( A340 )Advanced with a reinforced wing and 178 kN (40,000 lbf) engines: the Pratt & Whitney advanced ducted propulsor, CFM International CFMXX or Rolls Royce RB.411, to allow from 1996 a -300 stretch for 50 more passengers over the same range, a -300 with the -200 range and a -200 with more range. In 1995, the A340-400 was slated for 2000, seating 380 passengers with a 300 t (660,000 lb) take-off weight. In April 1996, GE Aviation obtained an exclusivity for the 13,000 km (7,000 nmi) 375-passenger -600 stretch with 226 kN (51,000 lbf) engines, above the 225.5 kN (50,700 lbf) limit of the CFM International partnership with SNECMA and dropping the 191 kN (43,000 lbf) CFMXX. The -600 would be stretched by 20\u201322 frames to 75 m (246 ft), unit thrust was raised from 227 kN (51,000 lbf) to 249 kN (56,000 lbf) and maximum takeoff weight would be increased to 330 t (730,000 lb). The wing area would increase by 56m\u00b2 (600 ft\u00b2) to 420 m2 (4,500 sq ft) through a larger chord needing a three-frame centre fuselage insert and retaining the existing front and rear spars, and a span increased by 3.5 to 63.8 m (11 to 209 ft), along a 25% increase in wing fuel capacity and four wheels replacing the centre twin bogie. A -500 with the larger wing and engines and three extra frames for 310 passengers would cover 15,725 km (8,490 nmi) to replace the smaller, 14,800 km (8,000 nmi) range, A340-8000. At least $1 billion would be needed to develop the airframe, excluding $2 billion for the engine development supported by the its manufacturer. A 12 frame -400 simple stretch would cover 11,290 km (6,100 nmi) with 340 passengers in three-class. It was enlarged by 40% to compete with the then in-development 777-300ER/200LR: the wing would be expanded with a tapered wing box insert along the span extension, it would have enlarged horizontal stabilizers and the larger A330-200 fin and it would need 222\u2013267 kN (50\u201360,000 lbf) of unit thrust. The ultra-long-haul 1.53 m (5.0 ft) -500 stretch would seat 316 passengers, a little more than the -300, over 15,355 km (8,290 nmi), while the 10.07 m (33.0 ft) -600 stretch would offer a 25% larger cabin for 372 passengers over a range of 7,400 nmi (13,700 km). MTOW was increased to 356 t (785,000 lb). Unwilling to commit to a $1 Billion development without a good return on investment prospects and a second application, in 1997 GE Aviation stopped exclusivity talks for a scaled down GE90 to 245\u2013290 kN (55\u201365,000 lbf), leaving Rolls-Royce Plc proposing a more cost-effective Rolls-Royce Trent variant needing less development and Pratt & Whitney: a PW2000 advanced ducted propulsor, a PW4000 derivative or a new geared turbofan. In June 1997, the 250 kN (56,000 lbf) Trent 500 was selected, with growth potential to 275 kN (62,000 lbf), derived from the A330 Trent 700 and the B777 Trent 800 with a reduced fan diameter and a new LP turbine, for a 7.7% lower TSFC than the 700. Airbus claims 10% lower operating costs per seat than the -300, 3% below those of the B777-3000ER. The $2.9 billion program was launched in December 1997 with 100 commitments from seven customers worth $3 billion, aiming to fly the first -600 in January 2001 and deliver it from early 2002 to capture at least half of the 1,500 sales forecast in the category through 2010. In 1998, the -600 stretch was stabilised at 20 frames for 10.6 m (35 ft), the MTOW rose to 365 t (805,000 lb) and the unit thrust to 52,000 to 60,000 lbf (230 to 270 kN), keeping the Trent 700 2.47 m (8.1 ft) fan diameter with its scaled IP and HP compressors and the high-speed, low-loading HP and IP turbines of the Trent 800. Despite the -500/600 introduction, sales slowed in the 2000s as the Boeing 777-200LR/-300ER dominated the long-range 300-400 seats market. The A340-500IGW/600HGW high gross weight variants did not arouse much sales interest. In January 2006, Airbus confirmed it studied an A340-600E (Enhanced), more fuel-efficient than earlier A340s, closing the 8\u20139% disparity with the Boeing 777 with new Trent 1500 engines and technologies from the A350 initial design. Besides lacking twinjet economy, the -600 was immature at service entry and had a high empty weight needing MTOW increases while the B777-300ER was a worthy competitor with a larger fuselage diameter, meeting design specs and being mature on service entry. At 380, the advertised three-class seating of the -600 was well above the real world average of 323 seats, while the B777-300ER is advertised for 365 and offers 332, impacting seat costs. By 2018, a 2006 -600 was worth $18M and a 2003 one $10M, projected to fall to $7M in 2021 with a $200,000/month lease rate falling to $180,000 in 2021; its D check cost $4.5M and its engine overhaul $3-6M.\nIn 2005, 155 B777s were ordered against 15 A340s: twin engine ETOPS restrictions were overcome by lower operating costs, compared to quad jets. In 2007, Airbus predicted that another 127 A340-300 ( A340 )aircraft would likely be produced through 2016, the projected end of production. On 10 November 2011, Airbus announced the end of the A340-300 ( A340 )program. At that time, the company indicated that all firm orders had been delivered. The decision to terminate the program came as A340-500/600 orders came to a halt, with analyst Nick Cunningham pointing out that the A340-300 ( A340 )\"was too heavy and there was a big fuel burn gap between the A340-300 ( A340 )and Boeing\u2019s 777\". Bertrand Grabowski, managing director of aircraft financier DVB Bank SE, noted \"in an environment where the fuel price is high, the A340-300 ( A340 )has had no chance to compete against similar twin engines, and the current lease rates and values of this aircraft reflect the deep resistance of any airlines to continue operating it\u201d. As a sales incentive amid low customer demand during the Great Recession, Airbus had offered buy-back guarantees to airlines that chose to procure the A340. By 2013, the resale value of an A340-300 ( A340 )declined by 30% over ten years, and both Airbus and Rolls-Royce were incurring related charges amounting to hundreds of millions of euros. Some analysts have expected the price of a flight-worthy, CFM56-powered A340-300 ( A340 )to drop below $10 million by 2023. Airbus could offer used A340s to airlines wishing to retire older aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, claiming that the cost of purchasing and maintaining a second-hand A340-300 ( A340 )with increased seating and improved engine performance reportedly compared favourably to the procurement costs of a new Boeing 777. In 2013, as ultra-long range is a niche, the A340-300 ( A340 )was less attractive with best usage on long, thin routes, from hot-and-high airports or as interim air charter. A 10 year old A340-300 had a base value of $35m and a market value of $24m, leading to $320,000/mo ($240,000-$350,000) lease rate, while a -500 is $425,000 and a -600 is leased $450,000 to $500,000 per month, versus $1.3m for a 777-300ER. The lighter A340-300 consumes 5% less fuel per trip with 300 passengers than the 312 passengers 777-200ER while the heavier A340-600 uses 12% more fuel than a 777-300ER. As an effort to support the A340's resale value, Airbus has proposed reconfiguring the aircraft's interior for a single class of 475 seats. As the Trent 500 engines are half the maintenance cost of the A340, Rolls-Royce proposed a cost-reducing maintenance plan similar to the company's existing program that reduced the cost of maintaining the RB211 engine powering Iberia's Boeing 757 freighters. Key to these programs is the salvaging, repair and reuse of serviceable parts from retired older engines. Airbus has positioned the larger versions of the A350, specifically the A350-900 and A350-1000, as the successors to the A340-500 and A340-600. The ACJ340 is listed on the Airbus Corporate Jets website, as Airbus can convert retired A340-300 ( A340 )airliners to VIP transport configuration.\nThe Airbus A340-300 ( A340 )is a wide-body twin-aisle passenger airliner which has the distinction of being the first truly long-range aircraft to be produced by Airbus. It is powered by four FADEC turbofan jet engines, optimized to perform long distance routes. The A340-300 ( A340 )had been built upon developments made in the production of earlier Airbus aircraft and as such shares many features with those aircraft, such as a common cockpit design with the Airbus A320 and A330; as the aircraft was developed at the same time as the A330, the two aircraft employ many similar components and sections, such as identical fly-by-wire control systems and similar wings. Both before and after the A340-300 ( A340 )entered revenue service, the features and improvements developed were usually shared with the A330. The A340-300 ( A340 )is a low-wing cantilever monoplane; for the A340-200 and A340-300 variants, the wing itself is virtually identical to that of the A330. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used. The A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing; also, the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW to carry more fuel for greater range. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[a] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (9.0 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 SuperFan, which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (184 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (192 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (198 ft). At 60.3 m (198 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The flight deck of the A340-300 ( A340 )is a glass cockpit, based upon the control systems first used on the smaller A320. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls. The main instrument panel is dominated by six cathode ray tube monitors which display information to the flight crew; on later aircraft, these monitors have been replaced by liquid crystal displays. Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). The aircraft monitoring system is connected to various sensors throughout the aircraft and automatically alerts the crew to any parameters detected outside of their normal range; pilots can also manually inspect systems of their choosing at any time. The information display system is designed to be easily interpreted and give a clear picture of the aircraft's operational status. Instead of paper manuals, electronic CD-ROM-based manuals are used; Airbus offers web-based updates to electronic documentation as an option. Many measures were taken from the start of the A340's design process to reduce the difficulty and cost of maintenance, which was reportedly half of that of the earlier Airbus A310 despite the increase in size. The aircraft's four engines featured improved controls and monitoring systems that enabled engine parameters to be more readily checked and avoid unnecessary early removals; the four-engine approach also avoided the stringent ETOPS requirements such as more frequent inspections. The A340-300 ( A340 )also has a centralised maintenance computer which provides comprehensive easily understandable systems information, which can be transmitted in real-time to ground facilities via the onboard satellite-based ACARS datalink. Some aspects of the maintenance, such as structural changes, remained unchanged, while increased sophistication of technology in the passenger cabin, like the in-flight entertainment systems, were increased over preceding airliners.\nThe first variant of the A340-300 ( A340 )to be introduced, the A340-200, entered service with the launch customer, Lufthansa, in 1993. It was followed shortly thereafter by the A340-300 with its operator, Air France. Lufthansa's first A340, which had been dubbed N\u00fcrnberg (D-AIBA), began revenue service on 15 March 1993. Air Lanka (later renamed Sri Lankan Airlines) became the Asian launch customer of the Airbus A340; the airline received its first A340-300, registered (4R-ADA), in September 1994. British airline Virgin Atlantic was an early adopter of the A340; in addition to operating several A340-300 aircraft, Virgin Atlantic announced in August 1997 that it was to be the worldwide launch customer for the new A340-600. The first commercial flight of the A340-600 was performed by Virgin in July 2002. Singapore Airlines ordered 17 A340-300s and operated them until October 2013. The A340-300s were purchased by Boeing as part of an order for Boeing 777s in 1999. The airline then purchased five long-range A340-500s, which joined the fleet in December 2003. In February 2004, the airline's A340-500 performed the longest non-stop commercial air service in the world, conducting a non-stop flight between Singapore and Los Angeles. In 2004, Singapore Airlines launched an even longer non-stop route using the A340-500 between Newark and Singapore, SQ 21, a 15,344 kilometres (8,285 nmi) journey that was the longest scheduled non-stop commercial flight in the world. The airline continued to operate this route regularly until the airline decided to retire the type in favour of new A380 and A350 aircraft; its last A340-300 ( A340 )flight was performed in late 2013. The A340-300 ( A340 )was typically used by airlines as a medium-sized long-haul aircraft, and was often a replacement for older Boeing 747s as it was more likely profitable. Airbus produced a number of A340s as large private jets for VIP customers, often to replace aging Boeing 747s in this same role. In 2008, Airbus launched a dedicated corporate jetliner version of the A340-200: one key selling point of this aircraft was a range of up to 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km). Airbus had built up to nine different customized versions of the A340-300 ( A340 )to private customer's specific demands prior to 2008. The A340-300 ( A340 )has frequently been operated as a dedicated transport for heads of state. A pair of A340-300s were acquired from Lufthansa by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force; they serve as VIP transports for the German Chancellor and other key members of the German government. The A340-300 ( A340 )is also operated by the air transport division of the French Air Force, where it is used as a strategic transport for troop deployments and supply missions, as well as to transport government officials. A one-of-a-kind aircraft, the A340-8000, was originally built for Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah. The aircraft was unused and stored in Hamburg until it was procured by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of the House of Saud, and later sold to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, then-President of Libya; the aircraft was operated by Afriqiyah Airways and was often referred to as Afriqiyah One. In 2008, jet fuel prices doubled compared to the year before; consequently, the A340's fuel consumption led airlines to reduce flight stages exceeding 15 hours. Thai Airways International cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's fuel fraction just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, Air France-KLM SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340-300 ( A340 )as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\". While Thai Airways consistently filled 80% of the seats on its New York City\u2013Bangkok flights, it estimated that, at 2008 fuel prices, it would need an impossible 120% of seats filled just to break even. Other airlines also re-examined long-haul flights. In August 2008 Cathay Pacific stated that rising fuel costs were hurting its trans-Pacific long-haul routes disproportionately, and that it would cut the number of such flights and redeploy its aircraft to shorter routes such as between Hong Kong and Australia. \"We will ... reshap[e] our network where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money.\" Aviation Week noted that rapid performance increases of twin-engine aircraft has led to the detriment of four-engine types of comparable capacity such as the A340-300 ( A340 )and 747; at this point most 747s had accumulated significant flying hours before retirement in contrast to A340s which were relatively young when grounded. By 2014, Singapore Airlines had phased out the type, discontinuing SQ21 and SQ22, which had been the longest non-stop scheduled flights in the world. Emirates Airlines decided to accelerate the retirement of its A340-300 ( A340 )fleet, writing down the value of the A340-500 type to zero despite the oldest -500 only being 10 years old, with president Tim Clark saying they \"designed in the late 1990s with fuel at $25-30. They fell over at $60 and at $120 they haven\u2019t got a hope in hell\". International Airlines Group, the parent of Iberia Airlines (which is also the operator of the last production A340-300 ( A340 )built), is overhauling its A340-600s for continued service for the foreseeable future, while it is retiring its A340-300s. The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. Lufthansa, which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340-300 ( A340 )more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue. In 2013, Snecma announced that they planned to use the A340-300 ( A340 )as a flying testbed for the development of a new open rotor engine. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines. The engine, partly based on the Snecma M88 turbofan engine used on the Dassault Rafale, is being developed under the European Clean Sky research initiative.\n\nCockpit crew in A340 - Two.\nSeating in A340 - 277 (3-class)  or 335 (30F + 305Y).\nExit limit in A340 - 375/440/375.\nLength in A340 - 63.69 m / 208.96 ft.\nWingspan in A340 - 60.3 m / 197.83 ft.\nWing in A340 - 363.1 m2 (3,908 sq ft), 29.7\u00b0 sweep, 10 AR.\nHeight in A340 - 16.99 m / 55.72 ft.\nFuselage in A340 - 5.287 m / 208.15 in cabin width, 5.64 m / 18.5 ft outside width.\nCargo volume in A340-300 ( A340 )  - 132.4 m3 (4,680 cu ft).\nMTOW in A340 - 275 t (606,000 lb).\nMax.

It first flew on 11 February 2002, and was certified on 3 December 2002. Air Canada was supposed to be the launch customer, but filed for bankruptcy in January 2003, delaying delivery to March. This allowed early deliveries to the new launch customer, Emirates, allowing the carrier to launch nonstop service from Dubai to New York\u2014its first route in the Americas. The A340-500 can fly 313 passengers in a three-class cabin layout over 16020 km (8650 nm). Compared with the A340-300, the -500 features a 4.3-metre (14.1 ft) fuselage stretch, an enlarged wing, significant increase in fuel capacity (around 50% over the -300), slightly higher cruising speed, a larger horizontal stabilizer and a larger vertical tailplane. The centerline main landing gear was changed to a four-wheel bogie to support additional weight. The A340-500 is powered by four 240 kN (54,000 lbf) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 553 turbofans and uses the Honeywell 331\u2013600[A] APU. Designed for ultra long-haul routes, the -500 has a range of 9,000 nautical miles, where the Boeing 777-200LR have a 8,555 nmi range, 445 fewer. Due to its range, the -500 is capable of travelling non-stop from London to Perth, Western Australia, though a return flight requires a fuel stop due to headwinds. Singapore Airlines used this model (initially in a two-class, 181-passenger layout, later in a 100-passenger business-only layout) between early 2004 and late 2013 for its Newark\u2013Singapore nonstop route, SQ 21: an 18-hour, 45-minute \"westbound\" (really northbound to 130 km (70 nm) abeam the North Pole; then south from there across Russia, Mongolia and People's Republic of China), 18-hour, 30-minute eastbound, 15,344 kilometres (8,285 nmi) journey that was the longest scheduled non-stop commercial flight in the world, Singapore Airlines even added a special compartment for a corpse, if a passenger were to die during a flight, though it was reported there had not had such need. Singapore Airlines ceased the operation partly due to high fuel price then and returned its aircraft to Airbus in exchange for ordering new Airbus A350. The A340-500IGW (Increased Gross Weight) version has a range of 17,000 km (9,200 nmi) and a MTOW of 380 t (840,000 lb) and first flew on 13 October 2006. It uses the strengthened structure and enlarged fuel capacity of the A340-600. The certification aircraft, a de-rated A340-541 model, became the first delivery, to Thai Airways International, on 11 April 2007. Nigerian airline Arik Air received a pair of A340-542s in November 2008, using the type to immediately launch two new routes, Lagos\u2013London Heathrow and Lagos\u2013Johannesburg; a non-stop Lagos\u2013New York route began in January 2010. The A340-500IGW is powered by four 250 kN (56,000 lbf) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 556 turbofans. Like the A340-200, a shortened derivative of the -300, the -500 was unpopular. The -500 series was considered \"very inefficient for how few seats they have because they still carry most of the guts of the larger airplanes [the A340-600] from which they were shrunk\". Also the ultra long-haul market was a niche that was difficult to profit from, due to the amount of fuel that had to be carried. In addition, the -500 could not meet its maximum range without carrying a reduced load of passengers, so several operators reconfigured their -500s from a mix of business and premium economy to an all-business class with 100 seats. As of July 2018, there were 3 A340-500s in airline service, 2 with Azerbaijan Airlines and 1 with Hi Fly.\n\nThe Airbus A340-500 ( A340 )is a long-range, four-engine, wide-body commercial passenger jet airliner that was developed and produced by the European aerospace company Airbus. The A340-500 ( A340 )was assembled in Toulouse, France. It seats up to 375 passengers in the standard variants and 440 in the stretched -600 series. Depending on the model, it has a range of 6,700 to 9,000 nautical miles (12,400 to 16,700 km; 7,700 to 10,400 mi). Its distinguishing features are four high-bypass turbofan engines and three-bogie main landing gear. The A340-500 ( A340 )was manufactured in four fuselage lengths. The initial variant, A340-300, which entered service in 1993, measured 63.69 metres (209.0 ft). The shorter -200 was developed next, and the A340-600 was a 15.96 metres (52.4 ft) stretch of the -200. The -600 was developed alongside the shorter A340-500, which would become the longest-range commercial airliner until the arrival of the Boeing 777-200LR. The -200 and -300 models were powered by the 151 kilonewtons (34,000 lbf) CFM56-5C, while the 267-kilonewton (60,000 lbf) Rolls-Royce Trent 500 was the exclusive powerplant for the extended-range -500 and -600 models. The initial A340-200 and -300 variants share the fuselage and wing of the twin-engine Airbus A330 with which it was concurrently designed. The heavier A340-500 and -600 are stretched and have enlarged wings. Launch customers Lufthansa and Air France placed the A340-500 ( A340 )into service in March 1993. In September 2011, 379 orders had been placed (not including private operators), of which 375 were delivered. The most common type were the A340-300 model, with 218 aircraft delivered. Lufthansa is the biggest operator of the A340, having acquired 59 aircraft. The A340-500 ( A340 )is used on long-haul, trans-oceanic routes due to its immunity from ETOPS restrictions; however, with reliability and fuel efficiency in engines improving, airlines have gradually phased out the type in favour of more economical twinjets of comparable capacity such as the Boeing 777, while Airbus has positioned the larger variants of the Airbus A350 as a successor. Airbus announced on 10 November 2011 that A340-500 ( A340 )production had been concluded.\nWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the Airbus A320 family, which was the first digital fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus. As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 in the single-aisle, narrow-body airliner market, Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market. The A300B11, a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" engines. It would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km). It was deemed the replacement for the less-efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s still in service. The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engine at the time. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. The B9 would offer the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, but would use between 25% to 38% less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered the replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. To differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for \"twin aisle\"), respectively. In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same wing and airframe; the projected savings were estimated at US$500 million (about \u00a3490 million or \u20ac495 million). The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled, North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982. While the TA9 had a range of 3,300 nautical miles (6,100 km), the TA11 range was up to 6,830 nautical miles (12,650 km). At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) lesser range. By the time of the Paris Air Show in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system and side-stick control. Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training. The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310. Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs. Airbus briefly considered a variable camber wing; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe) at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency. However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development. Airbus had held discussions with McDonnell Douglas to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the AM 300. This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its trijet heritage. Although from the start it was intended that the A340-500 ( A340 )would be powered by four CFM56-5 turbofan engines, each capable of 25,000 pounds-force (110 kN), Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the Rolls-Royce RB211-535 and Pratt & Whitney JT10D-232 (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980). As refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engines Corporation, Fiat and MTU Aero Engines (MTU). The engine nacelles of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the CFM56-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 500 engines. On 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in Munich, West Germany, after which board-chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a two-engine jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including Lufthansa and Swissair. \nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. Filton was the site of BAE's \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor area. BAe also spent \u00a35 million expanding the Chester wing production plant by 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with A\u00e9rospatiale starting construction of a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) assembly plant, adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, in Colomiers. By November 1988, the first 21 m (69 ft) pillars were erected for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall. The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots. The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time. British Aerospace accepted \u00a3450 million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750 million originally requested. Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter. Airbus also issued subcontracts to companies in Austria, Australia, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. The A330 and A340-500 ( A340 )programmes were jointly launched on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. The order book then stood at 130 aircraft from 10 customers, apart from the above-mentioned Lufthansa and International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Eighty-nine of the total orders were A340-500 ( A340 )models. At McDonnell Douglas, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important carrier, Singapore Airlines (SIA), required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter in the northern hemisphere. The MD-11, according to test results, would experience fuel starvation over the Balkans. Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, SIA cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on 2 August 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead. Despite selling 200 units, some[weasel words] consider that the MD-11 failed commercially and that it unsuccessfully competed against the A340. The first flight of the A340-500 ( A340 )occurred on 21 October 1991, marking the start of a 2,000-hour test flight programme involving six aircraft. From the start, engineers noticed that the wings were not stiff enough to carry the outboard engines at cruising speed without warping and fluttering. To alleviate this, an underwing bulge called a plastron was developed to correct airflow problems around the engine pylons and to add stiffness. European JAA certification was obtained on 22 December 1992; the FAA followed on 27 May 1993.\nThe first A340, a -200, was delivered to Lufthansa on 2 February 1993 and entered service on 15 March. The 228-seat airliner was named N\u00fcrnberg. The first A340-300, the 1000th Airbus, was delivered to Air France on 26 February, the first of nine it planned to operate by the end of the year. Air France replaced the Boeing 747 with the A340-500 ( A340 )on Paris\u2013Washington D.C., flying four times weekly. Lufthansa intended to replace aging DC-10s with the A340s on Frankfurt\u2013New York services. On 16 June 1993, an A340-200 dubbed the World Ranger flew from the Paris Air Show to Auckland, New Zealand in 21 hours 32 minutes and back in 21 hours 46 minutes after a five-hour stop; this was the first non-stop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest non-stop flight by an airliner at the time. The 19,277 km (10,409 nmi) flight from Paris to Auckland broke six world records with 22 persons and five center tanks.  Taking off at 11:58 local time, it arrived back in Paris 48 hours and 22 minutes later, at 12:20. This record held until 1997 when a Boeing 777-200ER flew 20,044 km (10,823 nmi) from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur.\nIn 1991, the A340-400X was a simple 12-frame, 20 ft 10 in (6.35 m) -300 stretch from 295 to 335 passengers with the MTOW bumped from 553,360 to 588,600 lb (251 to 267 t) and the range decreased by 750 to 5,900 nmi (1,390 to 10,930 km). CFM International was then set to develop for $1\u20131.5 billion a new engine between the 150 kN (34,000 lbf) CFM56 and the 315\u2013400 kN (70\u201390,000 lbf) GE90. In 1994, Airbus was studying a heavier A340-500 ( A340 )Advanced with a reinforced wing and 178 kN (40,000 lbf) engines: the Pratt & Whitney advanced ducted propulsor, CFM International CFMXX or Rolls Royce RB.411, to allow from 1996 a -300 stretch for 50 more passengers over the same range, a -300 with the -200 range and a -200 with more range. In 1995, the A340-400 was slated for 2000, seating 380 passengers with a 300 t (660,000 lb) take-off weight. In April 1996, GE Aviation obtained an exclusivity for the 13,000 km (7,000 nmi) 375-passenger -600 stretch with 226 kN (51,000 lbf) engines, above the 225.5 kN (50,700 lbf) limit of the CFM International partnership with SNECMA and dropping the 191 kN (43,000 lbf) CFMXX. The -600 would be stretched by 20\u201322 frames to 75 m (246 ft), unit thrust was raised from 227 kN (51,000 lbf) to 249 kN (56,000 lbf) and maximum takeoff weight would be increased to 330 t (730,000 lb). The wing area would increase by 56m\u00b2 (600 ft\u00b2) to 420 m2 (4,500 sq ft) through a larger chord needing a three-frame centre fuselage insert and retaining the existing front and rear spars, and a span increased by 3.5 to 63.8 m (11 to 209 ft), along a 25% increase in wing fuel capacity and four wheels replacing the centre twin bogie. A -500 with the larger wing and engines and three extra frames for 310 passengers would cover 15,725 km (8,490 nmi) to replace the smaller, 14,800 km (8,000 nmi) range, A340-8000. At least $1 billion would be needed to develop the airframe, excluding $2 billion for the engine development supported by the its manufacturer. A 12 frame -400 simple stretch would cover 11,290 km (6,100 nmi) with 340 passengers in three-class. It was enlarged by 40% to compete with the then in-development 777-300ER/200LR: the wing would be expanded with a tapered wing box insert along the span extension, it would have enlarged horizontal stabilizers and the larger A330-200 fin and it would need 222\u2013267 kN (50\u201360,000 lbf) of unit thrust. The ultra-long-haul 1.53 m (5.0 ft) -500 stretch would seat 316 passengers, a little more than the -300, over 15,355 km (8,290 nmi), while the 10.07 m (33.0 ft) -600 stretch would offer a 25% larger cabin for 372 passengers over a range of 7,400 nmi (13,700 km). MTOW was increased to 356 t (785,000 lb). Unwilling to commit to a $1 Billion development without a good return on investment prospects and a second application, in 1997 GE Aviation stopped exclusivity talks for a scaled down GE90 to 245\u2013290 kN (55\u201365,000 lbf), leaving Rolls-Royce Plc proposing a more cost-effective Rolls-Royce Trent variant needing less development and Pratt & Whitney: a PW2000 advanced ducted propulsor, a PW4000 derivative or a new geared turbofan. In June 1997, the 250 kN (56,000 lbf) Trent 500 was selected, with growth potential to 275 kN (62,000 lbf), derived from the A330 Trent 700 and the B777 Trent 800 with a reduced fan diameter and a new LP turbine, for a 7.7% lower TSFC than the 700. Airbus claims 10% lower operating costs per seat than the -300, 3% below those of the B777-3000ER. The $2.9 billion program was launched in December 1997 with 100 commitments from seven customers worth $3 billion, aiming to fly the first -600 in January 2001 and deliver it from early 2002 to capture at least half of the 1,500 sales forecast in the category through 2010. In 1998, the -600 stretch was stabilised at 20 frames for 10.6 m (35 ft), the MTOW rose to 365 t (805,000 lb) and the unit thrust to 52,000 to 60,000 lbf (230 to 270 kN), keeping the Trent 700 2.47 m (8.1 ft) fan diameter with its scaled IP and HP compressors and the high-speed, low-loading HP and IP turbines of the Trent 800. Despite the -500/600 introduction, sales slowed in the 2000s as the Boeing 777-200LR/-300ER dominated the long-range 300-400 seats market. The A340-500IGW/600HGW high gross weight variants did not arouse much sales interest. In January 2006, Airbus confirmed it studied an A340-600E (Enhanced), more fuel-efficient than earlier A340s, closing the 8\u20139% disparity with the Boeing 777 with new Trent 1500 engines and technologies from the A350 initial design. Besides lacking twinjet economy, the -600 was immature at service entry and had a high empty weight needing MTOW increases while the B777-300ER was a worthy competitor with a larger fuselage diameter, meeting design specs and being mature on service entry. At 380, the advertised three-class seating of the -600 was well above the real world average of 323 seats, while the B777-300ER is advertised for 365 and offers 332, impacting seat costs. By 2018, a 2006 -600 was worth $18M and a 2003 one $10M, projected to fall to $7M in 2021 with a $200,000/month lease rate falling to $180,000 in 2021; its D check cost $4.5M and its engine overhaul $3-6M.\nIn 2005, 155 B777s were ordered against 15 A340s: twin engine ETOPS restrictions were overcome by lower operating costs, compared to quad jets. In 2007, Airbus predicted that another 127 A340-500 ( A340 )aircraft would likely be produced through 2016, the projected end of production. On 10 November 2011, Airbus announced the end of the A340-500 ( A340 )program. At that time, the company indicated that all firm orders had been delivered. The decision to terminate the program came as A340-500/600 orders came to a halt, with analyst Nick Cunningham pointing out that the A340-500 ( A340 )\"was too heavy and there was a big fuel burn gap between the A340-500 ( A340 )and Boeing\u2019s 777\". Bertrand Grabowski, managing director of aircraft financier DVB Bank SE, noted \"in an environment where the fuel price is high, the A340-500 ( A340 )has had no chance to compete against similar twin engines, and the current lease rates and values of this aircraft reflect the deep resistance of any airlines to continue operating it\u201d. As a sales incentive amid low customer demand during the Great Recession, Airbus had offered buy-back guarantees to airlines that chose to procure the A340. By 2013, the resale value of an A340-500 ( A340 )declined by 30% over ten years, and both Airbus and Rolls-Royce were incurring related charges amounting to hundreds of millions of euros. Some analysts have expected the price of a flight-worthy, CFM56-powered A340-500 ( A340 )to drop below $10 million by 2023. Airbus could offer used A340s to airlines wishing to retire older aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, claiming that the cost of purchasing and maintaining a second-hand A340-500 ( A340 )with increased seating and improved engine performance reportedly compared favourably to the procurement costs of a new Boeing 777. In 2013, as ultra-long range is a niche, the A340-500 ( A340 )was less attractive with best usage on long, thin routes, from hot-and-high airports or as interim air charter. A 10 year old A340-300 had a base value of $35m and a market value of $24m, leading to $320,000/mo ($240,000-$350,000) lease rate, while a -500 is $425,000 and a -600 is leased $450,000 to $500,000 per month, versus $1.3m for a 777-300ER. The lighter A340-300 consumes 5% less fuel per trip with 300 passengers than the 312 passengers 777-200ER while the heavier A340-600 uses 12% more fuel than a 777-300ER. As an effort to support the A340's resale value, Airbus has proposed reconfiguring the aircraft's interior for a single class of 475 seats. As the Trent 500 engines are half the maintenance cost of the A340, Rolls-Royce proposed a cost-reducing maintenance plan similar to the company's existing program that reduced the cost of maintaining the RB211 engine powering Iberia's Boeing 757 freighters. Key to these programs is the salvaging, repair and reuse of serviceable parts from retired older engines. Airbus has positioned the larger versions of the A350, specifically the A350-900 and A350-1000, as the successors to the A340-500 and A340-600. The ACJ340 is listed on the Airbus Corporate Jets website, as Airbus can convert retired A340-500 ( A340 )airliners to VIP transport configuration.\nThe Airbus A340-500 ( A340 )is a wide-body twin-aisle passenger airliner which has the distinction of being the first truly long-range aircraft to be produced by Airbus. It is powered by four FADEC turbofan jet engines, optimized to perform long distance routes. The A340-500 ( A340 )had been built upon developments made in the production of earlier Airbus aircraft and as such shares many features with those aircraft, such as a common cockpit design with the Airbus A320 and A330; as the aircraft was developed at the same time as the A330, the two aircraft employ many similar components and sections, such as identical fly-by-wire control systems and similar wings. Both before and after the A340-500 ( A340 )entered revenue service, the features and improvements developed were usually shared with the A330. The A340-500 ( A340 )is a low-wing cantilever monoplane; for the A340-200 and A340-300 variants, the wing itself is virtually identical to that of the A330. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used. The A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing; also, the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW to carry more fuel for greater range. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[a] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (9.0 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 SuperFan, which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (184 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (192 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (198 ft). At 60.3 m (198 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The flight deck of the A340-500 ( A340 )is a glass cockpit, based upon the control systems first used on the smaller A320. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls. The main instrument panel is dominated by six cathode ray tube monitors which display information to the flight crew; on later aircraft, these monitors have been replaced by liquid crystal displays. Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). The aircraft monitoring system is connected to various sensors throughout the aircraft and automatically alerts the crew to any parameters detected outside of their normal range; pilots can also manually inspect systems of their choosing at any time. The information display system is designed to be easily interpreted and give a clear picture of the aircraft's operational status. Instead of paper manuals, electronic CD-ROM-based manuals are used; Airbus offers web-based updates to electronic documentation as an option. Many measures were taken from the start of the A340's design process to reduce the difficulty and cost of maintenance, which was reportedly half of that of the earlier Airbus A310 despite the increase in size. The aircraft's four engines featured improved controls and monitoring systems that enabled engine parameters to be more readily checked and avoid unnecessary early removals; the four-engine approach also avoided the stringent ETOPS requirements such as more frequent inspections. The A340-500 ( A340 )also has a centralised maintenance computer which provides comprehensive easily understandable systems information, which can be transmitted in real-time to ground facilities via the onboard satellite-based ACARS datalink. Some aspects of the maintenance, such as structural changes, remained unchanged, while increased sophistication of technology in the passenger cabin, like the in-flight entertainment systems, were increased over preceding airliners.\nThe first variant of the A340-500 ( A340 )to be introduced, the A340-200, entered service with the launch customer, Lufthansa, in 1993. It was followed shortly thereafter by the A340-300 with its operator, Air France. Lufthansa's first A340, which had been dubbed N\u00fcrnberg (D-AIBA), began revenue service on 15 March 1993. Air Lanka (later renamed Sri Lankan Airlines) became the Asian launch customer of the Airbus A340; the airline received its first A340-300, registered (4R-ADA), in September 1994. British airline Virgin Atlantic was an early adopter of the A340; in addition to operating several A340-300 aircraft, Virgin Atlantic announced in August 1997 that it was to be the worldwide launch customer for the new A340-600. The first commercial flight of the A340-600 was performed by Virgin in July 2002. Singapore Airlines ordered 17 A340-300s and operated them until October 2013. The A340-300s were purchased by Boeing as part of an order for Boeing 777s in 1999. The airline then purchased five long-range A340-500s, which joined the fleet in December 2003. In February 2004, the airline's A340-500 performed the longest non-stop commercial air service in the world, conducting a non-stop flight between Singapore and Los Angeles. In 2004, Singapore Airlines launched an even longer non-stop route using the A340-500 between Newark and Singapore, SQ 21, a 15,344 kilometres (8,285 nmi) journey that was the longest scheduled non-stop commercial flight in the world. The airline continued to operate this route regularly until the airline decided to retire the type in favour of new A380 and A350 aircraft; its last A340-500 ( A340 )flight was performed in late 2013. The A340-500 ( A340 )was typically used by airlines as a medium-sized long-haul aircraft, and was often a replacement for older Boeing 747s as it was more likely profitable. Airbus produced a number of A340s as large private jets for VIP customers, often to replace aging Boeing 747s in this same role. In 2008, Airbus launched a dedicated corporate jetliner version of the A340-200: one key selling point of this aircraft was a range of up to 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km). Airbus had built up to nine different customized versions of the A340-500 ( A340 )to private customer's specific demands prior to 2008. The A340-500 ( A340 )has frequently been operated as a dedicated transport for heads of state. A pair of A340-300s were acquired from Lufthansa by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force; they serve as VIP transports for the German Chancellor and other key members of the German government. The A340-500 ( A340 )is also operated by the air transport division of the French Air Force, where it is used as a strategic transport for troop deployments and supply missions, as well as to transport government officials. A one-of-a-kind aircraft, the A340-8000, was originally built for Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah. The aircraft was unused and stored in Hamburg until it was procured by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of the House of Saud, and later sold to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, then-President of Libya; the aircraft was operated by Afriqiyah Airways and was often referred to as Afriqiyah One. In 2008, jet fuel prices doubled compared to the year before; consequently, the A340's fuel consumption led airlines to reduce flight stages exceeding 15 hours. Thai Airways International cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's fuel fraction just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, Air France-KLM SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340-500 ( A340 )as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\". While Thai Airways consistently filled 80% of the seats on its New York City\u2013Bangkok flights, it estimated that, at 2008 fuel prices, it would need an impossible 120% of seats filled just to break even. Other airlines also re-examined long-haul flights. In August 2008 Cathay Pacific stated that rising fuel costs were hurting its trans-Pacific long-haul routes disproportionately, and that it would cut the number of such flights and redeploy its aircraft to shorter routes such as between Hong Kong and Australia. \"We will ... reshap[e] our network where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money.\" Aviation Week noted that rapid performance increases of twin-engine aircraft has led to the detriment of four-engine types of comparable capacity such as the A340-500 ( A340 )and 747; at this point most 747s had accumulated significant flying hours before retirement in contrast to A340s which were relatively young when grounded. By 2014, Singapore Airlines had phased out the type, discontinuing SQ21 and SQ22, which had been the longest non-stop scheduled flights in the world. Emirates Airlines decided to accelerate the retirement of its A340-500 ( A340 )fleet, writing down the value of the A340-500 type to zero despite the oldest -500 only being 10 years old, with president Tim Clark saying they \"designed in the late 1990s with fuel at $25-30. They fell over at $60 and at $120 they haven\u2019t got a hope in hell\". International Airlines Group, the parent of Iberia Airlines (which is also the operator of the last production A340-500 ( A340 )built), is overhauling its A340-600s for continued service for the foreseeable future, while it is retiring its A340-300s. The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. Lufthansa, which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340-500 ( A340 )more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue. In 2013, Snecma announced that they planned to use the A340-500 ( A340 )as a flying testbed for the development of a new open rotor engine. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines. The engine, partly based on the Snecma M88 turbofan engine used on the Dassault Rafale, is being developed under the European Clean Sky research initiative.\n\nCockpit crew in A340 - Two.\nSeating in A340 - 293  or 313 (12F + 36J + 265Y).\nExit limit in A340 - 375.\nLength in A340 - 67.93 m / 222.87 ft.\nWingspan in A340 - 63.45 m / 208.17 ft.\nWing in A340 - 437.3 m2 (4,707 sq ft), 31.1\u00b0 sweep, 9.2 AR.\nHeight in A340 - 17.53 m / 57.51 ft.\nFuselage in A340 - 5.287 m / 208.15 in cabin width, 5.64 m / 18.5 ft outside width.\nCargo volume in A340 - 149.7 m3 (5,290 cu ft).\nMTOW in A340 - 276.5 t (610,000 lb).\nMax.

It provides similar passenger capacity to a 747 but with 25 percent more cargo volume, and at lower trip and seat costs. First flight of the A340-600 was made on 23 April 2001. Virgin Atlantic began commercial services in August 2002. The variant's main competitor is the 777-300ER. The A340-600 will eventually be replaced by the A350-1000. The A340-600 is 12 m (39 ft 4.4 in) longer than a -300, more than 4 m (13 ft 1.5 in) longer than the Boeing 747-400 and 2.3 m (7 ft 6.6 in) longer than the A380. It held the record for the world's longest commercial aircraft until the first flight of the Boeing 747-8 in February 2010. The A340-600 is powered by four 250 kN (56,000 lbf) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 556 turbofans and uses the Honeywell 331\u2013600[A] APU. As with the -500, it has a four-wheel undercarriage bogie on the fuselage centre-line to cope with the increased MTOW along with the enlarged wing and rear empennage. Upper deck main cabin space can be optionally increased by locating facilities such as crew rest areas, galleys, and lavatories upon the aircraft's lower deck. In early 2007, Airbus reportedly advised carriers to reduce cargo in the forward section by 5.0 t (11,000 lb) to compensate for overweight first and business class sections; the additional weight caused the aircraft's centre of gravity to move forward thus reducing cruise efficiency. Affected airlines considered filing compensation claims with Airbus. The A340-600HGW (High Gross Weight) version first flew on 18 November 2005 and was certified on 14 April 2006. It has an MTOW of 380 t (840,000 lb) and a range of up to 14,630 km (7,900 nmi), made possible by strengthened structure, increased fuel capacity, more powerful engines and new manufacturing techniques like laser beam welding. The A340-600HGW is powered by four 61,900 lbf (275 kN) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 560 turbofans. Emirates became the launch customer for the -600HGW when it ordered 18 at the 2003 Paris Air Show; but postponed its order indefinitely and later cancelled. Rival Qatar Airways, which placed its order at the same airshow, took delivery of only four aircraft with the first aircraft on 11 September 2006. The airline has since let its purchase options expire in favour of orders for the Boeing 777-300ER. As of July 2018, there were 60 A340-600s in service with six airlines worldwide.\n\nThe airbus A340-600 ( A340 )is a long-range, four-engine, wide-body commercial passenger jet airliner that was developed and produced by the European aerospace company Airbus. The A340-600 ( A340 )was assembled in Toulouse, France. It seats up to 375 passengers in the standard variants and 440 in the stretched -600 series. Depending on the model, it has a range of 6,700 to 9,000 nautical miles (12,400 to 16,700 km; 7,700 to 10,400 mi). Its distinguishing features are four high-bypass turbofan engines and three-bogie main landing gear. The A340-600 ( A340 )was manufactured in four fuselage lengths. The initial variant, A340-300, which entered service in 1993, measured 63.69 metres (209.0 ft). The shorter -200 was developed next, and the A340-600 was a 15.96 metres (52.4 ft) stretch of the -200. The -600 was developed alongside the shorter A340-500, which would become the longest-range commercial airliner until the arrival of the Boeing 777-200LR. The -200 and -300 models were powered by the 151 kilonewtons (34,000 lbf) CFM56-5C, while the 267-kilonewton (60,000 lbf) Rolls-Royce Trent 500 was the exclusive powerplant for the extended-range -500 and -600 models. The initial A340-200 and -300 variants share the fuselage and wing of the twin-engine Airbus A330 with which it was concurrently designed. The heavier A340-500 and -600 are stretched and have enlarged wings. Launch customers Lufthansa and Air France placed the A340-600 ( A340 )into service in March 1993. In September 2011, 379 orders had been placed (not including private operators), of which 375 were delivered. The most common type were the A340-300 model, with 218 aircraft delivered. Lufthansa is the biggest operator of the A340, having acquired 59 aircraft. The A340-600 ( A340 )is used on long-haul, trans-oceanic routes due to its immunity from ETOPS restrictions; however, with reliability and fuel efficiency in engines improving, airlines have gradually phased out the type in favour of more economical twinjets of comparable capacity such as the Boeing 777, while Airbus has positioned the larger variants of the Airbus A350 as a successor. Airbus announced on 10 November 2011 that A340-600 ( A340 )production had been concluded.\nWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the Airbus A320 family, which was the first digital fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus. As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 in the single-aisle, narrow-body airliner market, Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market. The A300B11, a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" engines. It would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km). It was deemed the replacement for the less-efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s still in service. The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engine at the time. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. The B9 would offer the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, but would use between 25% to 38% less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered the replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. To differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for \"twin aisle\"), respectively. In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same wing and airframe; the projected savings were estimated at US$500 million (about \u00a3490 million or \u20ac495 million). The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled, North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982. While the TA9 had a range of 3,300 nautical miles (6,100 km), the TA11 range was up to 6,830 nautical miles (12,650 km). At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) lesser range. By the time of the Paris Air Show in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system and side-stick control. Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training. The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310. Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs. Airbus briefly considered a variable camber wing; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe) at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency. However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development. Airbus had held discussions with McDonnell Douglas to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the AM 300. This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its trijet heritage. Although from the start it was intended that the A340-600 ( A340 )would be powered by four CFM56-5 turbofan engines, each capable of 25,000 pounds-force (110 kN), Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the Rolls-Royce RB211-535 and Pratt & Whitney JT10D-232 (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980). As refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, Japanese Aero Engines Corporation, Fiat and MTU Aero Engines (MTU). The engine nacelles of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the CFM56-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 500 engines. On 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in Munich, West Germany, after which board-chairman Franz Josef Strau\u00df released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\". The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a two-engine jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including Lufthansa and Swissair. \nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. Filton was the site of BAE's \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor area. BAe also spent \u00a35 million expanding the Chester wing production plant by 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with A\u00e9rospatiale starting construction of a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) assembly plant, adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, in Colomiers. By November 1988, the first 21 m (69 ft) pillars were erected for the new Cl\u00e9ment Ader assembly hall. The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots. The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time. British Aerospace accepted \u00a3450 million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750 million originally requested. Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter. Airbus also issued subcontracts to companies in Austria, Australia, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. The A330 and A340-600 ( A340 )programmes were jointly launched on 5 June 1987, just prior to the Paris Air Show. The order book then stood at 130 aircraft from 10 customers, apart from the above-mentioned Lufthansa and International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Eighty-nine of the total orders were A340-600 ( A340 )models. At McDonnell Douglas, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important carrier, Singapore Airlines (SIA), required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter in the northern hemisphere. The MD-11, according to test results, would experience fuel starvation over the Balkans. Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, SIA cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on 2 August 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead. Despite selling 200 units, some[weasel words] consider that the MD-11 failed commercially and that it unsuccessfully competed against the A340. The first flight of the A340-600 ( A340 )occurred on 21 October 1991, marking the start of a 2,000-hour test flight programme involving six aircraft. From the start, engineers noticed that the wings were not stiff enough to carry the outboard engines at cruising speed without warping and fluttering. To alleviate this, an underwing bulge called a plastron was developed to correct airflow problems around the engine pylons and to add stiffness. European JAA certification was obtained on 22 December 1992; the FAA followed on 27 May 1993.\nThe first A340, a -200, was delivered to Lufthansa on 2 February 1993 and entered service on 15 March. The 228-seat airliner was named N\u00fcrnberg. The first A340-300, the 1000th Airbus, was delivered to Air France on 26 February, the first of nine it planned to operate by the end of the year. Air France replaced the Boeing 747 with the A340-600 ( A340 )on Paris\u2013Washington D.C., flying four times weekly. Lufthansa intended to replace aging DC-10s with the A340s on Frankfurt\u2013New York services. On 16 June 1993, an A340-200 dubbed the World Ranger flew from the Paris Air Show to Auckland, New Zealand in 21 hours 32 minutes and back in 21 hours 46 minutes after a five-hour stop; this was the first non-stop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest non-stop flight by an airliner at the time. The 19,277 km (10,409 nmi) flight from Paris to Auckland broke six world records with 22 persons and five center tanks.  Taking off at 11:58 local time, it arrived back in Paris 48 hours and 22 minutes later, at 12:20. This record held until 1997 when a Boeing 777-200ER flew 20,044 km (10,823 nmi) from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur.\nIn 1991, the A340-400X was a simple 12-frame, 20 ft 10 in (6.35 m) -300 stretch from 295 to 335 passengers with the MTOW bumped from 553,360 to 588,600 lb (251 to 267 t) and the range decreased by 750 to 5,900 nmi (1,390 to 10,930 km). CFM International was then set to develop for $1\u20131.5 billion a new engine between the 150 kN (34,000 lbf) CFM56 and the 315\u2013400 kN (70\u201390,000 lbf) GE90. In 1994, Airbus was studying a heavier A340-600 ( A340 )Advanced with a reinforced wing and 178 kN (40,000 lbf) engines: the Pratt & Whitney advanced ducted propulsor, CFM International CFMXX or Rolls Royce RB.411, to allow from 1996 a -300 stretch for 50 more passengers over the same range, a -300 with the -200 range and a -200 with more range. In 1995, the A340-400 was slated for 2000, seating 380 passengers with a 300 t (660,000 lb) take-off weight. In April 1996, GE Aviation obtained an exclusivity for the 13,000 km (7,000 nmi) 375-passenger -600 stretch with 226 kN (51,000 lbf) engines, above the 225.5 kN (50,700 lbf) limit of the CFM International partnership with SNECMA and dropping the 191 kN (43,000 lbf) CFMXX. The -600 would be stretched by 20\u201322 frames to 75 m (246 ft), unit thrust was raised from 227 kN (51,000 lbf) to 249 kN (56,000 lbf) and maximum takeoff weight would be increased to 330 t (730,000 lb). The wing area would increase by 56m\u00b2 (600 ft\u00b2) to 420 m2 (4,500 sq ft) through a larger chord needing a three-frame centre fuselage insert and retaining the existing front and rear spars, and a span increased by 3.5 to 63.8 m (11 to 209 ft), along a 25% increase in wing fuel capacity and four wheels replacing the centre twin bogie. A -500 with the larger wing and engines and three extra frames for 310 passengers would cover 15,725 km (8,490 nmi) to replace the smaller, 14,800 km (8,000 nmi) range, A340-8000. At least $1 billion would be needed to develop the airframe, excluding $2 billion for the engine development supported by the its manufacturer. A 12 frame -400 simple stretch would cover 11,290 km (6,100 nmi) with 340 passengers in three-class. It was enlarged by 40% to compete with the then in-development 777-300ER/200LR: the wing would be expanded with a tapered wing box insert along the span extension, it would have enlarged horizontal stabilizers and the larger A330-200 fin and it would need 222\u2013267 kN (50\u201360,000 lbf) of unit thrust. The ultra-long-haul 1.53 m (5.0 ft) -500 stretch would seat 316 passengers, a little more than the -300, over 15,355 km (8,290 nmi), while the 10.07 m (33.0 ft) -600 stretch would offer a 25% larger cabin for 372 passengers over a range of 7,400 nmi (13,700 km). MTOW was increased to 356 t (785,000 lb). Unwilling to commit to a $1 Billion development without a good return on investment prospects and a second application, in 1997 GE Aviation stopped exclusivity talks for a scaled down GE90 to 245\u2013290 kN (55\u201365,000 lbf), leaving Rolls-Royce Plc proposing a more cost-effective Rolls-Royce Trent variant needing less development and Pratt & Whitney: a PW2000 advanced ducted propulsor, a PW4000 derivative or a new geared turbofan. In June 1997, the 250 kN (56,000 lbf) Trent 500 was selected, with growth potential to 275 kN (62,000 lbf), derived from the A330 Trent 700 and the B777 Trent 800 with a reduced fan diameter and a new LP turbine, for a 7.7% lower TSFC than the 700. Airbus claims 10% lower operating costs per seat than the -300, 3% below those of the B777-3000ER. The $2.9 billion program was launched in December 1997 with 100 commitments from seven customers worth $3 billion, aiming to fly the first -600 in January 2001 and deliver it from early 2002 to capture at least half of the 1,500 sales forecast in the category through 2010. In 1998, the -600 stretch was stabilised at 20 frames for 10.6 m (35 ft), the MTOW rose to 365 t (805,000 lb) and the unit thrust to 52,000 to 60,000 lbf (230 to 270 kN), keeping the Trent 700 2.47 m (8.1 ft) fan diameter with its scaled IP and HP compressors and the high-speed, low-loading HP and IP turbines of the Trent 800. Despite the -500/600 introduction, sales slowed in the 2000s as the Boeing 777-200LR/-300ER dominated the long-range 300-400 seats market. The A340-500IGW/600HGW high gross weight variants did not arouse much sales interest. In January 2006, Airbus confirmed it studied an A340-600E (Enhanced), more fuel-efficient than earlier A340s, closing the 8\u20139% disparity with the Boeing 777 with new Trent 1500 engines and technologies from the A350 initial design. Besides lacking twinjet economy, the -600 was immature at service entry and had a high empty weight needing MTOW increases while the B777-300ER was a worthy competitor with a larger fuselage diameter, meeting design specs and being mature on service entry. At 380, the advertised three-class seating of the -600 was well above the real world average of 323 seats, while the B777-300ER is advertised for 365 and offers 332, impacting seat costs. By 2018, a 2006 -600 was worth $18M and a 2003 one $10M, projected to fall to $7M in 2021 with a $200,000/month lease rate falling to $180,000 in 2021; its D check cost $4.5M and its engine overhaul $3-6M.\nIn 2005, 155 B777s were ordered against 15 A340s: twin engine ETOPS restrictions were overcome by lower operating costs, compared to quad jets. In 2007, Airbus predicted that another 127 A340-600 ( A340 )aircraft would likely be produced through 2016, the projected end of production. On 10 November 2011, Airbus announced the end of the A340-600 ( A340 )program. At that time, the company indicated that all firm orders had been delivered. The decision to terminate the program came as A340-500/600 orders came to a halt, with analyst Nick Cunningham pointing out that the A340-600 ( A340 )\"was too heavy and there was a big fuel burn gap between the A340-600 ( A340 )and Boeing\u2019s 777\". Bertrand Grabowski, managing director of aircraft financier DVB Bank SE, noted \"in an environment where the fuel price is high, the A340-600 ( A340 )has had no chance to compete against similar twin engines, and the current lease rates and values of this aircraft reflect the deep resistance of any airlines to continue operating it\u201d. As a sales incentive amid low customer demand during the Great Recession, Airbus had offered buy-back guarantees to airlines that chose to procure the A340. By 2013, the resale value of an A340-600 ( A340 )declined by 30% over ten years, and both Airbus and Rolls-Royce were incurring related charges amounting to hundreds of millions of euros. Some analysts have expected the price of a flight-worthy, CFM56-powered A340-600 ( A340 )to drop below $10 million by 2023. Airbus could offer used A340s to airlines wishing to retire older aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, claiming that the cost of purchasing and maintaining a second-hand A340-600 ( A340 )with increased seating and improved engine performance reportedly compared favourably to the procurement costs of a new Boeing 777. In 2013, as ultra-long range is a niche, the A340-600 ( A340 )was less attractive with best usage on long, thin routes, from hot-and-high airports or as interim air charter. A 10 year old A340-300 had a base value of $35m and a market value of $24m, leading to $320,000/mo ($240,000-$350,000) lease rate, while a -500 is $425,000 and a -600 is leased $450,000 to $500,000 per month, versus $1.3m for a 777-300ER. The lighter A340-300 consumes 5% less fuel per trip with 300 passengers than the 312 passengers 777-200ER while the heavier A340-600 uses 12% more fuel than a 777-300ER. As an effort to support the A340's resale value, Airbus has proposed reconfiguring the aircraft's interior for a single class of 475 seats. As the Trent 500 engines are half the maintenance cost of the A340, Rolls-Royce proposed a cost-reducing maintenance plan similar to the company's existing program that reduced the cost of maintaining the RB211 engine powering Iberia's Boeing 757 freighters. Key to these programs is the salvaging, repair and reuse of serviceable parts from retired older engines. Airbus has positioned the larger versions of the A350, specifically the A350-900 and A350-1000, as the successors to the A340-500 and A340-600. The ACJ340 is listed on the Airbus Corporate Jets website, as Airbus can convert retired A340-600 ( A340 )airliners to VIP transport configuration.\nThe Airbus A340-600 ( A340 )is a wide-body twin-aisle passenger airliner which has the distinction of being the first truly long-range aircraft to be produced by Airbus. It is powered by four FADEC turbofan jet engines, optimized to perform long distance routes. The A340-600 ( A340 )had been built upon developments made in the production of earlier Airbus aircraft and as such shares many features with those aircraft, such as a common cockpit design with the Airbus A320 and A330; as the aircraft was developed at the same time as the A330, the two aircraft employ many similar components and sections, such as identical fly-by-wire control systems and similar wings. Both before and after the A340-600 ( A340 )entered revenue service, the features and improvements developed were usually shared with the A330. The A340-600 ( A340 )is a low-wing cantilever monoplane; for the A340-200 and A340-300 variants, the wing itself is virtually identical to that of the A330. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used. The A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing; also, the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW to carry more fuel for greater range. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[a] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8\u20139 per cent. Each wing also has a 2.74 m (9.0 ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 SuperFan, which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m (184 ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m (192 ft) and finally to 60.3 m (198 ft). At 60.3 m (198 ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with 35 percent less wing area. The flight deck of the A340-600 ( A340 )is a glass cockpit, based upon the control systems first used on the smaller A320. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls. The main instrument panel is dominated by six cathode ray tube monitors which display information to the flight crew; on later aircraft, these monitors have been replaced by liquid crystal displays. Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). The aircraft monitoring system is connected to various sensors throughout the aircraft and automatically alerts the crew to any parameters detected outside of their normal range; pilots can also manually inspect systems of their choosing at any time. The information display system is designed to be easily interpreted and give a clear picture of the aircraft's operational status. Instead of paper manuals, electronic CD-ROM-based manuals are used; Airbus offers web-based updates to electronic documentation as an option. Many measures were taken from the start of the A340's design process to reduce the difficulty and cost of maintenance, which was reportedly half of that of the earlier Airbus A310 despite the increase in size. The aircraft's four engines featured improved controls and monitoring systems that enabled engine parameters to be more readily checked and avoid unnecessary early removals; the four-engine approach also avoided the stringent ETOPS requirements such as more frequent inspections. The A340-600 ( A340 )also has a centralised maintenance computer which provides comprehensive easily understandable systems information, which can be transmitted in real-time to ground facilities via the onboard satellite-based ACARS datalink. Some aspects of the maintenance, such as structural changes, remained unchanged, while increased sophistication of technology in the passenger cabin, like the in-flight entertainment systems, were increased over preceding airliners.\nThe first variant of the A340-600 ( A340 )to be introduced, the A340-200, entered service with the launch customer, Lufthansa, in 1993. It was followed shortly thereafter by the A340-300 with its operator, Air France. Lufthansa's first A340, which had been dubbed N\u00fcrnberg (D-AIBA), began revenue service on 15 March 1993. Air Lanka (later renamed Sri Lankan Airlines) became the Asian launch customer of the Airbus A340; the airline received its first A340-300, registered (4R-ADA), in September 1994. British airline Virgin Atlantic was an early adopter of the A340; in addition to operating several A340-300 aircraft, Virgin Atlantic announced in August 1997 that it was to be the worldwide launch customer for the new A340-600. The first commercial flight of the A340-600 was performed by Virgin in July 2002. Singapore Airlines ordered 17 A340-300s and operated them until October 2013. The A340-300s were purchased by Boeing as part of an order for Boeing 777s in 1999. The airline then purchased five long-range A340-500s, which joined the fleet in December 2003. In February 2004, the airline's A340-500 performed the longest non-stop commercial air service in the world, conducting a non-stop flight between Singapore and Los Angeles. In 2004, Singapore Airlines launched an even longer non-stop route using the A340-500 between Newark and Singapore, SQ 21, a 15,344 kilometres (8,285 nmi) journey that was the longest scheduled non-stop commercial flight in the world. The airline continued to operate this route regularly until the airline decided to retire the type in favour of new A380 and A350 aircraft; its last A340-600 ( A340 )flight was performed in late 2013. The A340-600 ( A340 )was typically used by airlines as a medium-sized long-haul aircraft, and was often a replacement for older Boeing 747s as it was more likely profitable. Airbus produced a number of A340s as large private jets for VIP customers, often to replace aging Boeing 747s in this same role. In 2008, Airbus launched a dedicated corporate jetliner version of the A340-200: one key selling point of this aircraft was a range of up to 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km). Airbus had built up to nine different customized versions of the A340-600 ( A340 )to private customer's specific demands prior to 2008. The A340-600 ( A340 )has frequently been operated as a dedicated transport for heads of state. A pair of A340-300s were acquired from Lufthansa by the Flugbereitschaft of the German Air Force; they serve as VIP transports for the German Chancellor and other key members of the German government. The A340-600 ( A340 )is also operated by the air transport division of the French Air Force, where it is used as a strategic transport for troop deployments and supply missions, as well as to transport government officials. A one-of-a-kind aircraft, the A340-8000, was originally built for Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah. The aircraft was unused and stored in Hamburg until it was procured by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of the House of Saud, and later sold to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, then-President of Libya; the aircraft was operated by Afriqiyah Airways and was often referred to as Afriqiyah One. In 2008, jet fuel prices doubled compared to the year before; consequently, the A340's fuel consumption led airlines to reduce flight stages exceeding 15 hours. Thai Airways International cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's fuel fraction just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, Air France-KLM SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340-600 ( A340 )as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\". While Thai Airways consistently filled 80% of the seats on its New York City\u2013Bangkok flights, it estimated that, at 2008 fuel prices, it would need an impossible 120% of seats filled just to break even. Other airlines also re-examined long-haul flights. In August 2008 Cathay Pacific stated that rising fuel costs were hurting its trans-Pacific long-haul routes disproportionately, and that it would cut the number of such flights and redeploy its aircraft to shorter routes such as between Hong Kong and Australia. \"We will ... reshap[e] our network where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money.\" Aviation Week noted that rapid performance increases of twin-engine aircraft has led to the detriment of four-engine types of comparable capacity such as the A340-600 ( A340 )and 747; at this point most 747s had accumulated significant flying hours before retirement in contrast to A340s which were relatively young when grounded. By 2014, Singapore Airlines had phased out the type, discontinuing SQ21 and SQ22, which had been the longest non-stop scheduled flights in the world. Emirates Airlines decided to accelerate the retirement of its A340-600 ( A340 )fleet, writing down the value of the A340-500 type to zero despite the oldest -500 only being 10 years old, with president Tim Clark saying they \"designed in the late 1990s with fuel at $25-30. They fell over at $60 and at $120 they haven\u2019t got a hope in hell\". International Airlines Group, the parent of Iberia Airlines (which is also the operator of the last production A340-600 ( A340 )built), is overhauling its A340-600s for continued service for the foreseeable future, while it is retiring its A340-300s. The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. Lufthansa, which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340-600 ( A340 )more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue. In 2013, Snecma announced that they planned to use the A340-600 ( A340 )as a flying testbed for the development of a new open rotor engine. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines. The engine, partly based on the Snecma M88 turbofan engine used on the Dassault Rafale, is being developed under the European Clean Sky research initiative.\n\nCockpit crew in A340 - Two.\nSeating in A340 - 326  or 380 (12F + 54J + 314Y).\nExit limit in A340 - 440.\nLength in A340 - 75.36 m / 247.24 ft.\nWingspan in A340 - 63.45 m / 208.17 ft.\nWing in A340 - 437.3 m2 (4,707 sq ft), 31.1\u00b0 sweep, 9.2 AR.\nHeight in A340 - 17.93 m / 58.84 ft.\nFuselage in A340 - 5.287 m / 208.15 in cabin width, 5.64 m / 18.5 ft outside width.\nCargo volume in A340 - 201.7 m3 (7,120 cu ft).\nMTOW in A340 - 380 t (840,000 lb).\nMax.

It seats 366 passengers in a typical three-class layout with a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). With a 9-abreast configuration, it is designed to replace the Airbus A340-600 and compete with the Boeing 777-300ER and 777-9. Airbus estimates a 366-seat -1000 should have a 35 t lighter operating empty weight than a 398-seat 777-9, a 15% lower trip cost, a 7% lower seat cost, and a 400 nmi (740 km) greater range. Compared to a Boeing 777-300ER with 360 seats, Airbus claims a 25% fuel burn per seat advantage for an A350-1000 with 369 seats. The 7 m (23 ft) extension seats 40 more passengers with 40% more premium area. The -1000 can match the 40 more seats of the 777-9 by going 10-abreast but with diminished comfort. The A350-1000 has an 11-frame stretch over the \u2212900 and a slightly larger wing than the \u2212800/900 models with trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%. This will extend the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around 400 mm, optimising flap lift performance as well as cruise performance. The main landing gear is a 6-wheel bogie instead of a 4-wheel bogie, put in a one frame longer bay. The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine's thrust is augmented to 97,000 lbf (430 kN). These and other engineering upgrades are necessary so that the \u22121000 model maintains range. In 2011, Airbus redesigned the A350-1000 with higher weights and a more powerful engine variant for more range for trans-Pacific operations which will boost its appeal to Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, which committed to 20 777-9, and United Airlines, which could turn to 777-300ERs to replace its 747-400s. Emirates was disappointed with the changes and cancelled its order for 50 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s instead of citing the whole order to the larger variant. Assembly of the first fuselage major components started in September 2015. In February 2016, final assembly started at the A350 Final Assembly Line in Toulouse. Three flight test aircraft was planned with entry into service scheduled for mid-2017. The first aircraft completed its body join on 15 April 2016. Its maiden flight took place on 24 November 2016. The A350-1000 flight-test programme planned for 1,600 flight hours; 600 hours on the first aircraft, MSN59, for the flight envelope, systems and powerplant checks; 500 hours on MSN71 for cold and warm campaigns, landing gear checks and high-altitude tests; and 500 hours on MSN65 for route proving and ETOPS assessment, with an interior layout for cabin development and certification. In cruise at Mach 0.854 (912 km/h; 492 kn) and 35,000 ft, its fuel flow at 259 t (571,000 lb) is 6.8 t (15,000 lb) per hour within a 10,000 km (5,400 nm), 11 h 30 m early long test flight. Flight tests allowed raising the Maximum Take-Off Weight from 308 to 316 t (679,000 to 697,000 lb), the 8 t (18,000 lb) increase giving 450 nmi (830 km) more range. Airbus then completed functional and reliability testing. Type Certification was awarded by EASA on 21 November 2017, along FAA certification. The first serial unit was on the final assembly line in early December. After its maiden flight on 7 December, delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways slipped to early 2018. The delay was due to issues with the business class seat installation. It was delivered on 20 February and entered commercial service on Qatar Airways' Doha to London Heathrow route on 24 February. It features an automatic emergency descent function to around 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and notifies air traffic control if the crew fails to respond to an alert, indicating possible incapacitation from depressurisation. The avionics software adaptation is activated by a push and pull button to avoid mistakes and could be retrofitted in the smaller -900. All performance targets have been met or exceeded and it remains within its weight specification, unlike early \u2212900s. Its basic 308 t (679,000 lb) maximum take-off weight was bumped to 311 t (686,000 lb) before offering a possible 316 t (697,000 lb) version. Its 316 t MTOW appeared in the 29 May 2018 update of its type certificate data sheet. This raised its range from 7,950 to 8,400 nmi (14,720 to 15,560 km). A further MTOW increase by 3 t to 319 t is under study to be available from 2020 and could be a response to Qantas' Project Sunrise.\nHigh performance, designed with airlines' priorities in mind, the A350 XWB meets the multiple challenges of high fuel prices, rising expectations from passengers and increasing environmental concerns. As with the other A350 XWB Family members, Airbus\u2019 A350-1000 brings together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies for a 25 percent step change in fuel efficiency compared to its current long-range competitor. Seven metres longer than the A350-900; the A350-1000 features modified wing trailing-edges, larger six-wheel main landing gears, an advanced airframe with extensive use of composite materials, and the world\u2019s most efficient large aero-engine.\nAirspace by Airbus, the A350 XWB Family cabin design proved to be so successful that it redefined Airbus\u2019 approach to cabin interiors \u2013 leading to the creation of Airspace by Airbus, a next-generation cabin concept inspired by four key attributes: comfort, service, ambience and design. The A350-1000 offers passengers the quietest twin-aisle cabin in the skies, wider seats and elegant LED ambient lighting that not only contributes to a beautiful interior, but minimises the effects of jetlag, as well. The A350-1000 also can offer passengers the most modern in-flight experience available. With movies on-demand included within a range of features, passengers can stay entertained throughout their flight, while the availability of Wi-Fi connectivity can ensure that they can stay in touch with the world below; whether it\u2019s posting to social networks, staying on top of important business emails or something else, there\u2019s no need to be out of touch when you\u2019re in the air.\nInnovation, the A350 XWB is truly innovative, with new technology throughout the entirety of the aircraft. From the design of the wings that morph and change shape in flight to obtain optimal efficiency to the flight controls and system that reduce the pilot\u2019s workload, this aircraft utilizes modern technology to create a better way of flying. Nowhere is this innovation more apparent than in the A350 XWB\u2019s fuselage, built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic. The combination of these technological advances ensures that the A350-1000 burns 25 percent less fuel than its nearest competitor, saving money and reducing harmful effects to the environment.\nIncreased efficiency, powering the A350-1000 are Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines that allow the largest member of the A350 XWB Family to attain high levels of efficiency. Each engine provides 97,000 lbs. of thrust on takeoff \u2013 the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft \u2013 providing additional payload capability and range. With these specially-tailored Trent XWB powerplants, the A350-1000 is capable of long-haul routes to emerging markets such as Shanghai-Boston or Paris-Santiago, as well as more traditional flight segments as Manchester-Los Angeles or Dubai-Melbourne.\n\nThe Airbus A350 XWB is a family of long-range, twin-engine wide-body jet airliners developed by European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre reinforced polymer. Its variants seat 280 to 366 passengers in typical three-class seating layouts. The A350 is positioned to succeed the A340 and to compete with the Boeing 787 and 777. The A350 was originally conceived in 2004 as a pairing of the A330's fuselage with new aerodynamics features and engines. In 2006, Airbus redesigned the aircraft in response to negative feedback from several major prospective customers, producing the \"A350 XWB\" (eXtra Wide Body). Development costs are estimated at \u20ac11 billion (US$15 billion or \u00a39.5 billion). As of June 2018, Airbus had received 882 orders for A350s from 45 customers worldwide. The prototype A350 first flew on 14 June 2013 from Toulouse, France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency was received in September 2014 and certification from the Federal Aviation Administration two months later. On 15 January 2015, the A350-900 entered service with its launch operator Qatar Airways, and the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same airline.\nThe most perfect designs often are found in nature. That\u2019s why Airbus looks to learn from the natural world when designing and improving upon its aircraft. As the newest member of the company\u2019s widebody family, the A350 XWB is an example of how this inspirational blend of science and nature represents another significant evolution in the ongoing mission to conceive and manufacture the perfect aircraft. The A350 XWB has learned from nature to help ensure a healthy future for the planet, whether it\u2019s the revolutionary adaptive wing design \u2013 inspired by birds \u2013 which morphs while airborne to achieve maximum aerodynamic efficiency by optimising wing loading, reducing drag and lowering fuel burn; or the savings generated by innovative technological advances. Designed with passengers and airlines at heart, the A350 XWB benefits from being built with over 70 per cent advanced materials; combining carbon composites (53 per cent), titanium and modern aluminium alloys, to create a lighter and more cost-efficient aircraft while also reducing maintenance requirements. The latest generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines are quieter and more efficient. The combination of these advantages result in 25 per cent lower operating costs, fuel burn and C02 emissions when compared with previous-generation aircraft \u2013 showing Airbus\u2019 commitment to protecting the environment while remaining at the cutting edge of air travel. \nIt\u2019s not only the technology that has been transformed. When Airbus designed the A350 XWB, a cabin was created that is so comfortable it revolutionised the approach to all of the company\u2019s aircraft interiors. As the founding member of the Airspace by Airbus cabin family, passengers on the A350 XWB can experience a feeling of on-board comfort like never before. The aircraft\u2019s innovative design delivers a feeling of spaciousness wherever you look, with wider seats, high ceilings and alluring ambient lighting. Airbus has produced the perfect environment in which to enjoy flying to any long-haul destination. The A350 XWB\u2019s cabin also is the quietest on a twin-aisle aircraft, and its advanced technology delivers the highest possible air quality with optimised cabin altitude (6000 ft), temperature and humidity, with the air being renewed every two-to-three minutes. Passengers can relax knowing that Airbus has thought of everything to ensure that they can arrive feeling fresh. Long journeys pass quickly with the latest-generation in-flight experience. Integrated connectivity lets passengers stay in touch with the rest of the world, while smart galleys and comfortable crew rest areas provide cabin crew with a pleasant working environment that makes it even easier to look after passengers.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this brilliantly-designed aircraft is one of the most versatile in the sky. The A350 XWB actually offers true long-range capability of up to 8,100 nautical miles, but can also be easily configured to operate both regional and ultra-long haul routes (up to 9,700nm), demonstrating its full operational flexibility. The A350 XWB also perfectly complements the A330 Family, offering significant advantages to airlines operating both aircraft. Whether it is in terms of route planning or the reduced training time for pilots familiar with A330 (thanks to the common type rating), a seamless integration of the two families is highly economical and proves the value of the A350 XWB\u2019s innovative design.\nAirbus initially rejected Boeing's claim that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be a serious threat to the Airbus A330, stating that the 787 was just a reaction to the A330 and that no response was needed. When airlines urged Airbus to provide a competitor, Airbus initially proposed the \"A330-200Lite\", a derivative of the A330 featuring improved aerodynamics and engines similar to those on the 787. The company planned to announce this version at the 2004 Farnborough Airshow, but did not proceed. On 16 September 2004, Airbus president and chief executive officer No\u00ebl Forgeard confirmed the consideration of a new project during a private meeting with prospective customers. Forgeard did not give a project name, and he did not state whether it would be an entirely new design or a modification of an existing product. Airline dissatisfaction with this proposal motivated Airbus to commit \u20ac4 billion to a new airliner design. The original version of the A350 superficially resembled the A330 due to its common fuselage cross-section and assembly. A new wing, engines, and a horizontal stabiliser\u2013to be coupled with new composite materials and production methods applied to the fuselage\u2013would make the A350 an almost all-new aircraft. On 10 December 2004, the boards of EADS and BAE Systems, then the shareholders of Airbus, gave Airbus an \"authorisation to offer\" (ATO) and formally named it the A350. On 13 June 2005 at the Paris Air Show, Middle Eastern carrier Qatar Airways announced that they had placed an order for 60 A350s. In September 2006 the airline signed a memorandum of understanding with General Electric to launch the GEnx-1A-72 engine for the aircraft. Emirates sought a more improved design and decided against ordering the initial version of the A350. On 6 October 2005, the programme's industrial launch was announced with an estimated development cost of around \u20ac3.5 billion. The A350 was initially planned to be a 250- to 300-seat twin-engine wide-body aircraft derived from the existing A330's design. Under this plan, the A350 would have modified wings and new engines while sharing the A330's fuselage cross-section. As a result of a controversial design, the fuselage was to consist primarily of aluminium-lithium rather than the carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) fuselage on the Boeing 787. The A350 would see entry in two versions: the A350-800 with a 8,800 nmi (16,300 km) range with a typical passenger capacity of 253 in a three-class configuration, and the A350-900 with 7,500 nmi (13,900 km) range and a 300-seat 3-class configuration. The A350 was designed to be a direct competitor to the Boeing 787-9 and 777-200ER. The A350 was publicly criticised by two of Airbus's largest customers, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). On 28 March 2006, ILFC President Steven F. Udvar-H\u00e1zy urged Airbus to pursue a clean-sheet design or risk losing market share to Boeing and branded Airbus's strategy as \"a Band-aid reaction to the 787\", a sentiment echoed by GECAS president Henry Hubschman. In April 2006, while reviewing bids for the Boeing 787 and A350, CEO of Singapore Airlines (SIA) Chew Choon Seng, commented that \"having gone through the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, cockpit... [Airbus] should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage.\" Airbus responded that they were considering A350 improvements to satisfy customer demands. Airbus's then-CEO Gustav Humbert stated, \"Our strategy isn't driven by the needs of the next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises.\" As major airlines such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines selected the 787 over the A350, Humbert tasked an engineering team to produce new alternative designs. One such proposal, known internally as \"1d\", formed the basis of the A350 redesign.\nOn 14 July 2006, during the Farnborough Airshow, the redesigned aircraft was designated \"A350 XWB\" (Xtra-Wide-Body). Within four days, Singapore Airlines agreed to order 20 A350XWBs with options for another 20 A350XWBs. The proposed A350 was a new design, including a wider fuselage cross-section, allowing seating arrangements ranging from an eight-abreast low-density premium economy layout to a ten-abreast high-density seating configuration for a maximum seating capacity of 440\u2013475 depending on variant. The A330 and previous iterations of the A350 would only be able to accommodate a maximum of eight seats per row. The 787 is typically configured for nine seats per row. The 777 accommodates nine or ten seats per row, with more than half of recent 777s being ten-abreast as the 777X will be. The A350 cabin is 12.7 cm (5.0 in) wider at the eye level of a seated passenger than the 787's cabin, and 28 cm (11 in) narrower than the Boeing 777's cabin. (See Wide-body aircraft for a comparison of cabin widths and seating.) All A350 passenger models will have a range of at least 8,000 nmi (14,816 km). The redesigned composite fuselage provides higher cabin pressure and humidity, and lower maintenance costs. On 1 December 2006, the Airbus board of directors approved the industrial launch of the A350-800, -900, and -1000 variants. The delayed launch decision was a result of delays of the Airbus A380 and discussions on how to fund development. EADS CEO Thomas Enders stated that the A350 programme was not a certainty, citing EADS/Airbus's stretched resources. However, it was decided programme costs are to be borne mainly from cash-flow. First delivery for the A350-900 was scheduled for mid-2013, with the -800 and -1000 following on 12 and 24 months later, respectively. New technical details of the A350 XWB were revealed at a press conference in December 2006. John Leahy indicated existing A350 contracts were being re-negotiated due to price increases compared to the original A350s contracted. On 4 January 2007, Pegasus Aviation Finance Company placed the first firm order for the A350 XWB with an order for two aircraft. The design change imposed a two-year delay into the original timetable and increased development costs from US$5.3 billion (\u20ac5.5 billion) to approximately US$10 billion (\u20ac9.7 billion). The total development cost for the A350 was estimated at US$15 billion by Reuters (\u20ac12 billion or \u00a310 billion). The original mid-2013 delivery date of the A350 changed, as a longer than anticipated development forced Airbus to delay the final assembly and first flight of the aircraft to the third quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2013 respectively. As a result, the flight test schedule was compressed from the original 15 months to 12 months. A350 programme chief Didier Evrard stressed that delays only affected the A350-900 while the -800 and -1000 schedules remained unchanged.\nAirbus suggested Boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the aircraft structure. The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes). Airbus used a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers. In 2006, Airbus confirmed development of a full bleed air system on the A350, as opposed to the 787's bleedless configuration. Rolls-Royce agreed with Airbus to supply a new variant of the Trent turbofan engine for the A350 XWB, named Trent XWB. In 2010, after low-speed wind tunnel tests, Airbus finalised the static thrust at sea level for all three proposed variants to the 330\u2013420 kN (74,000\u201394,000 lbf) range. General Electric (GE) stated it would not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that previous contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 did not apply to the XWB. Engine Alliance partner Pratt & Whitney seemed to be at odds with GE on this, having publicly stating that it was looking at an advanced derivative of the GP7000. In April 2007, Airbus former chief executive Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB. In June 2007, Airbus's chief operating officer John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to offer a more efficient version for the airliner. Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it can offer a product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants. In January 2008, French-based Thales Group won a US$2.9 billion (\u20ac2 billion) 20-year contract to supply avionics and navigation equipment for the A350 XWB, beating Honeywell and Rockwell Collins. US-based Rockwell Collins and Moog Inc were chosen to supply the horizontal stabiliser actuator and primary flight control actuation, respectively. The flight management system incorporated several new safety features. Regarding cabin ergonomics and entertainment, in 2006 Airbus signed a firm contract with BMW for development of an interior concept for the original A350. On 4 February 2010, Airbus signed a contract with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to deliver in-flight entertainment and communication (IFEC) systems for the Airbus A350 XWB.\nIn 2008, Airbus planned to introduce new techniques and procedures to cut assembly time in half. The A350 XWB production programme sees extensive international collaboration and investments in new facilities: Airbus constructed 10 new factories in Western Europe and the US, with extensions carried out on 3 further sites. Among the new buildings was a \u00a3570 million (US$760 million or \u20ac745 million) composite facility in Broughton, Wales, which would be responsible for the wings. In June 2009, the National Assembly for Wales announced provision of a \u00a328 million grant to provide a training centre, production jobs and money toward the new production centre. Airbus manufactured the first structural component in December 2009. Production of the first fuselage barrel began in late 2010 at its production plant in Illescas, Spain. Construction of the first A350-900 centre wingbox was set to start in August 2010. The new composite rudder plant in China opened in early 2011. The forward fuselage of the first A350 was delivered to the final assembly plant in Toulouse on 29 December 2011. Final assembly of the first A350 static test model was started on 5 April 2012. Final assembly of the first prototype A350 was completed in December 2012. The production rate was expected to rise from three aircraft per month in early 2015 to five at the end of 2015, and would ramp to ten aircraft per month by 2018. In 2015, 17 planes would be delivered and the initial dispatch reliability was 98%. Airbus plans to increase its production rate from 10 monthly in 2018 to 13 monthly from 2019, while the Boeing 787 production will increase from 12 to 14 per month in 2019, and six A330 are produced monthly. Around 90 deliveries are expected in 2018, with about 15% -1000s (\u224814).\nThe first Trent engine test was made on 14 June 2010. The Trent XWB's flight test programme began use on the A380 development aircraft in early 2011, ahead of engine certification in late 2011. On 2 June 2013, the Trent XWB engines were powered up on the A350 for the first time. Airbus confirmed that the flight test programme would last 12 months and use five test aircraft. The A350's maiden flight took place on 14 June 2013 from the Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport. Airbus's chief test pilot said, \"it just seemed really happy in the air...all the things we were testing had no major issues at all.\" It flew for 4 hours, reaching Mach .8 at 25,000 feet after retracting the landing gear and starting a 2,500 h flight test campaign. A350 XWB, F-WWCF, msn. 2, underwent two-and-a-half weeks of climatic tests in the unique McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in May 2014, and was subjected to multiple climatic and humidity settings from a high of 45 \u00b0C to as low as -40 \u00b0C. The A350 received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 30 September 2014. On 15 October 2014, EASA approved the A350-900 for ETOPS 370, allowing it to fly more than six hours on one engine and making it the first airliner to be approved for \"ETOPS Beyond 180 minutes\" before entry into service. Later that month Airbus received regulatory approval for a Common Type Rating for pilot training between the A350 XWB and A330. On 12 November 2014, the A350 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration.\nIn June 2011, the A350-900 was scheduled to enter service in the first half of 2014, with the -800 to enter service in mid-2016, and the -1000 in 2017. In July 2012, Airbus delayed the -900's introduction by three months to the second half of 2014. The first delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways took place on 22 December 2014. The first commercial flight was made on 15 January 2015 between Doha and Frankfurt. One year after introduction, the A350 fleet had accumulated 3,000 cycles and around 16,000 flight hours. Average daily usage by first customers was 11.4 hours with flights averaging 5.2 hours, which are under the aircraft's capabilities and reflect both short flights within the schedules of Qatar Airways and Vietnam Airlines, as well as flight-crew proficiency training that is typical of early use and is accomplished on short-haul flights. Finnair was operating the A350 at very high rates: 15 flight hours per day for Beijing, 18 hours for Shanghai, and more than 20 hours for Bangkok. This may have accelerated its retirement of the Airbus A340. In service problems had included three areas. The onboard Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul network needed software improvements. Airbus issued service bulletins regarding onboard equipment and removed galley inserts (coffee makers, toaster ovens) because of leaks. Airbus had to address spurious overheating warnings in the bleed air system by retrofitting an original connector with a gold-plated connector. Airbus targeted a 98.5 percent dependability by the end of 2016 and to match the mature A330 reliability by early 2019. By the end of May 2016, the in-service fleet had flown 55,200 hours over 9,400 cycles at a 97.8 percent operational reliability on three months. The longest operated sector was Qatar Airways' Adelaide\u2013Doha at 13.8 hours for 6,120 nmi (11,334 km). 45 percent of flights were under 3,000 nmi (5,556 km), 16 percent over 5,000 nmi (9,260 km), and 39 percent in between. The average flight was 6.8 hours, with the longest average being 9.6 hours by TAM Airlines and the shortest being 2.1 hours by Cathay Pacific's. Aircraft seat configuration ranged from 253 seats for Singapore Airlines to 348 seats for TAM Airlines, with a 30 to 46 seat business class and a 211 to 318 seat economy class, often including a premium economy. The first A350-1000 was assembled in 2016, for a first flight on 24 November and entry into service planned for mid-2017. In January 2017, two years after introduction, 62 aircraft were in service with 10 airlines. They had accumulated 25,000 flights over 154,000 hours with an average daily utilisation of 12.5 hours, and transported six million passengers with a 98.7 percent operational reliability. Zodiac Aerospace had business class seats production difficulties in its Gainesville, Texas and Santa Maria, California factories. After a year, Cathay Pacific experienced cosmetic quality issues and upgraded or replaced the seats for the earliest cabins. In 2017, average test flights before delivery decreased to 4.1 from 12 in 2014, with an average delay down to 25 days from 68. Its reliability was 97.2 percent in 2015, 98.3 percent in 2016, and 98.8 percent in June 2017, just behind its 99 percent target for 2017. In June 2017 after 30 months in commercial operation, 80 A350 were in service with 12 operators, the largest being Qatar Airways with 17 and 13 each at Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines (SIA). The fleet average block time was 7.2 hours with 53 percent below 3,000 nmi (5,556 km), 16 percent over 5,000 nmi (9,260 km), and 31 percent in between. LATAM Airlines had the longest average sector at 10.7 hours, and Asiana had the shortest at 3.8 hours. Singapore Airlines operated the longest leg, Singapore to San Francisco 7,340 nmi (13,594 km), and the shortest leg, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur 160 nmi (296 km). In 2016, 49 were delivered and the monthly rate should grow to 10 by the end of 2018. Seating varied from 253 for Singapore Airlines to 389 for Air Cara\u00efbes, with most between 280 and 320. In October 2017, Airbus was testing extended sharklets, which could offer 100\u2013140 nmi (185\u2013259 km) extra range and reduce fuel burn by 1.4\u20131.6 percent. The wing twist is being changed for the wider, optimised spanload pressure distribution, and they will be used for the Singapore Airlines A350-900ULR in 2018 before spreading to other variants. Iberia will be the first to get the upgraded -900 in June 2018, with a 280 t (617,294 lb) MTOW version for a 8,200 nmi (15,186 km) range with 325 passengers in three classes. As of February 2018, 142 -900 had been delivered, with a dispatch reliability of 99.3 percent.\nIn September 2007, Airbus rolled out new design advances to a gathering of 100 representatives from existing and potential XWB customers. The A350 XWB is based on the technologies developed for the Airbus A380 and includes a similar cockpit and fly-by-wire systems layout. Airbus expects 10 percent lower airframe maintenance compared with the original A350 design and 14 percent lower empty seat weight than the Boeing 777. Design freeze for the A350-900 was achieved in December 2008.\nThe A350 XWB airframe will be made out of 53 percent composites: carbon fibre reinforced plastic for the outer and centre wing box (covers, stringers, spars), fuselage (skin, frame, keel beam, and rear fuselage) and the empennage (horizontal and vertical tailplanes); 19 percent aluminium and aluminium-lithium alloy for ribs, floor beams, and gear bays; 14 percent titanium for landing gears, pylons, and attachments; 6 percent steel; and 8 percent miscellaneous. The A350's competitor, the Boeing 787, is 50 percent composites, 20 percent aluminium, 15 percent titanium, 10 percent steel, and 5 percent other.\nThe A350 XWB fuselage has a constant width from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous Airbus aircraft, to provide maximum usable volume. The double-lobe (ovoid) fuselage cross-section has a maximum outer diameter of 5.97 m (19.6 ft), compared to 5.64 m (18.5 ft) for the A330/A340. The cabin's internal width is 5.61 m (18.4 ft) at armrest level compared to 5.49 m (18.0 ft) in the Boeing 787 and 5.87 m (19.3 ft) in the Boeing 777. It allows for an eight-abreast 2\u20134\u20132 arrangement in a premium economy layout, with the seats being 49.5 cm (19.5 in) wide between 5 cm (2.0 in) wide arm rests. Airbus says that the seat will be 1.3 cm (0.5 in) wider than a 787 seat in the equivalent configuration. In the nine-abreast, 3\u20133\u20133 standard economy layout, the A350 seat will be 45 cm (18 in) wide, 1.27 cm (0.5 in) wider than a seat in the equivalent layout in the 787, and 3.9 cm (1.5 in) wider than a seat in the equivalent A330 layout. The current 777 and future derivatives have 1.27 cm (0.5 in) greater seat width than the A350 in a nine-abreast configuration. The 10-abreast seating on the A350 is similar to a 9-abreast configuration on the A330, with a seat width of 41.65 cm (16.4 in). Overall, Airbus promises passengers more headroom, larger overhead storage space, and wider panoramic windows than current Airbus models. The A350 nose section has a configuration derived from the A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen. This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original design. The new nose improves aerodynamics and enables overhead crew rest areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing the width of the centre post. The upper shell radius of the nose section has been increased. The nose is likely to be constructed from aluminium but Airbus is currently running trade-off studies considering a one-piece carbon fibre structure. According to Gordon McConnell, A350 Chief Engineer, a carbon fibre structure would need titanium reinforcements for birdstrike protection, thus the aluminium structure is the best cost-wise.\nAirbus adopted a new philosophy for the attachment of the A350's main undercarriage as part of the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10. Airbus devised a three-pronged main undercarriage design philosophy encompassing both four- and six-wheel bogies to ensure it can keep the pavement loading within limits. The A350-900 will have four-wheel bogies in a 4.1 m (13 ft) long bay. The higher weight variant, the A350-1000 will use a six-wheel bogie, with a 4.7 m (15 ft) undercarriage bay. French-based Messier-Dowty will provide the main undercarriage for the -900 variant, and UTC Aerospace Systems will supply the \u22121000 variant. The nose gear will be supplied by Liebherr Aerospace.\nThe A350 features new composite wings with a wingspan that is common to the proposed variants. Its 64.75 m (212.4 ft) wingspan stays within the same ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code E 65m limit as the A330/A340, and the Boeing 777. The A350's wing has a 31.9\u00b0 sweep angle for a Mach 0.85 cruise speed and have a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.89. The -900 wing covers a 442 m2 (4,760 sq ft) area. This is between the 436.8 m2 (4,702 sq ft) wing of the current Boeing 777-200LR/300ER and the 466.8 m2 (5,025 sq ft) wing of the in-development Boeing 777X. However, Boeing and Airbus doesn't have the same measurement area. The A350-1000 wing is 22.3m\u00b2 (240 ft\u00b2) larger through a 30 cm (12 in) extension to the inboard sections of the fixed trailing edge. A new trailing-edge high-lift device has been adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap similar to that of the Airbus A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect differentially. The manufacturer has extensively used computational fluid dynamics and also carried out more than 4,000 hours of low- and high-speed windtunnel testing to refine the aerodynamic design. The final configuration of wing and winglet was achieved for the \"Maturity Gate 5\" on 17 December 2008. The wingtip device curves upwards over the final 4.4 m (14 ft). The wings are produced in the new \u00a3400M, 46,000 m2 (500,000 sq ft) North Factory at Airbus Broughton, employing 650 workers, in a specialist facility constructed with \u00a329M of support from the Welsh Government.\nThe revised design of the A350 XWB's glass cockpit dropped the A380-sized display and adopted 38 cm (15 in) liquid-crystal display screens. The new six-screen configuration includes two central displays mounted one above the other (the lower one above the thrust levers) and a single (for each pilot) primary flight/navigation display, with an adjacent on-board information system screen. Airbus says the cockpit design allows for future advances in navigation technology to be placed on the displays plus gives flexibility and capacity to upload new software and to combine data from multiple sources and sensors for flight management and aircraft systems control. A head-up display is also present in the cockpit. The avionics is a further development of the integrated modular avionics (IMA) concept found on the A380. The A350's IMA will manage up to 40 functions (versus 23 functions for the A380) such as undercarriage, fuel, pneumatics, cabin environmental systems, and fire detection. Airbus stated that the benefits includes reduced maintenance and lower weight because as the IMA replaces multiple processors and LRUs with around 50 percent fewer standard computer modules known as line-replaceable modules. The IMA runs on a 100 Mbit/s network based on the AFDX standard, as employed in the A380, in place of the architecture used on the A330/A340.\nThe Rolls-Royce Trent XWB feature a 118 in (300 cm) fan disk diameter and the design will be based on the advanced developments of the Airbus A380 Trent 900 and the Boeing 787 Trent 1000. It has two thrust levels to power the A350 variants: a 84,000 lbf (370 kN) for the A350-900 and a 97,000 lbf (430 kN) for the A350-1000. The higher-thrust version will have some modifications to the fan module\u2014it will be the same diameter but will run slightly faster and have a new fan blade design\u2014and run at increased temperatures allowed by new materials technologies from Rolls-Royce's research. The Trent XWB may also benefit from the next-generation reduced acoustic mode scattering engine duct system (RAMSES), an acoustic quieting engine nacelle intake, and a carry-on design of the Airbus's \"zero splice\" intake liner developed for the A380. A \"hot and high\" rating option for Middle Eastern customers Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways keep its thrust available at higher temperatures and altitudes. Airbus is aiming to certify the A350 with 350-minute ETOPS capability on entry into service. That could reach 420 min later, although Airbus achieved a 370\u2013minute ETOPS rating on 15 October 2014 which covers 99.7% of the Earth's surface. Engine thrust-reversers and nacelles will be supplied by US-based UTC Aerospace Systems.\nHoneywell supplies its 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) HGT1700 auxiliary power unit with 10 percent greater power density than the TPE331 from which it is developed, and the air management system: the bleed air, environmental control, cabin pressure control and supplemental cooling systems. Airbus says that the new design provides a better cabin atmosphere with 20 percent humidity, a typical cabin altitude at or below 6,000 ft (1,800 m) and an airflow management system that adapts cabin airflow to passenger load with draught-free air circulation. The ram air turbine, capable of generating 100 kilovolt-ampere, is supplied by Hamilton Sundstrand and located in the lower surface of the fuselage. In light of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems, in February 2013 Airbus decided to revert from lithium-ion to the proven nickel-cadmium technology although the flight test programme will continue with the lithium-ion battery systems. In late 2015, MSN24 was delivered with 176 lb (80 kg) lighter Saft Li-ion batteries and in June 2017, fifty A350s were flying with them and benefiting from a two-year maintenance schedule instead of NiCd\u2019s 4\u20136 months. Parker Hannifin supplies the complete fuel package: inerting system, fuel measurement and management systems, mechanical equipment and fuel pumps. The fuel tank inerting system features air-separation modules to generate nitrogen-enriched air to reduce the flammability of fuel vapour in the tanks. Parker also provides hydraulic power generation and distribution system: reservoirs, manifolds, accumulators, thermal control, isolation, software and new engine- and electric motor-driven pump designs. Parker estimates the contracts will generate more than $2 billion in revenues over the life of the programme.\nVariants: the three main variants of the A350 were launched in 2006, with entry into service planned for 2013. At the 2011 Paris Air Show, Airbus postponed the entry into service of the A350-1000 by two years to mid-2017. In July 2012, the A350's entry into service was delayed to the second half of 2014, before the -900 began service on 15 January 2015. In October 2012, the -800 was due to enter service in mid-2016, but its development has been cancelled since September 2014. The A350 is also offered as the ACJ350 corporate jet by Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), offering a 20,000 km (10,800 nmi) range for 25 passengers for the -900 derivative.\nA350-900ULR:\nThe MTOW of the ultra-long range -900ULR is being increased to 280 t (620,000 lb) and its fuel capacity from 141,000 to 165,000 l (37,000 to 44,000 US gal) within existing fuel tanks, enabling up to 19-hour flights with a 9,700 nmi (18,000 km) range. The MTOW is increased by 5 tonnes from the previously certified 275 tonnes variant. Because the A350-900's fuel consumption is 5.8 tonnes/hour, it needs an additional 24 tonnes of fuel to fly 19 hours instead of the standard 15 hours: the increased MTOW and lower payloads will enable the larger fuel capacity. Non-stop flights could last more than 20 hours. The first \u2212900ULR was rolled out without its engines in February 2018 for ground testing, and debuted flight-tests after engine installation to check the larger fuel capacity and to measure the performance improvements from the extended winglets. It made its first flight on 23 April 2018. Singapore Airlines, the launch customer, will use its seven -900ULR aircraft on non-stop flights between Singapore and New York City, and cities on the U.S. west coast. Singapore Airlines' seating is to be from 170 in largely business class seating up to over 250 in mixed seating. The planes can be reconfigured. They will have two seating classes. The airline received its first -900ULR on 23 September 2018, with 67 business class seats and 94 premier economy seats. On 12 October, it landed the world's longest flight in New York/Newark from Singapore Changi after 17 h 52 mn. The flight covered 16,562 km (8,943 nmi) for a 15,353 km (8,290 nmi) orthodromic distance. It burned 101.4 t (224,000 lb) of fuel to cover the route in 17h22m: an average of 5.8 t/h. At the 2015 Dubai Air Show, Airbus's John Leahy noted the appetite of the Middle East gulf airlines for this variant. In February 2018, Qatar Airways expressed no interest in the -900ULR. Compared to the standard -900, the -900ULR additional value is likely around $2 million.\nACJ350:\nAirbus Corporate Jet version of the A350, the ACJ350, is derived from the A350-900ULR. As a result of the increased fuel capacity from the -900ULR, the ACJ350 has a maximum range of 20,000 km (10,800 nmi).\nA350 Regional:\t\nAfter the Boeing 787-10 launch at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Airbus discussed with airlines a possible A350-900 Regional with a reduced MTOW of 250 tonnes and engine thrust reduced to 70,000-75,000 lb (from the standard 85,000 lb). The variant was said to be optimised for routes up to 6,800 nmi (12,594 km) with seating for up to 360 passengers in a single-class layout. Etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines were said to be ordering the A350 Regional. Since 2013, there has been no further announcement about this variant.\nAirbus has explored the possibility of a further stretch offering 45 more seats. A potential 4 m stretch would remain within the exit limit of four door pairs, and a modest MTOW increase from 308 t to 319 t would need only 3% more thrust, within the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 capabilities, and would allow a 14,100 km (7,600 nmi) range to compete with the Boeing 777-9 capabilities. This variant was to be a replacement for the Boeing 747-400, tentatively dubbed the A350-8000, -2000 or -1100. Within the June 2016 Airbus Innovation Days, chief commercial officer John Leahy was concerned about the size of a 400-seat market besides the Boeing 747-8 and the 777-9 and chief executive Fabrice Br\u00e9gier feared such an aircraft could cannibalise demand for the -1000. The potential 79 m-long (258 ft) airplane was competing against a hypothetical 777-10X for Singapore Airlines. At the 2017 Paris Air Show, the concept was shelved for lacking market appeal and in January 2018 Fabrice Br\u00e9gier focused on enhancing the A350-900/1000 to capture potential before 2022/2023, when it will be possible to stretch the A350 with a new engine generation.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A350 - Two.\nSeating in A350 - 366/369 (54B+315Y)387 (2-class).\nExit limit in A350 - 440.\nOverall length in A350 - 73.78 m / 242.7 ft.\nWing in A350 - 64.75 m / 212.43 ft span, 31.9\u00b0 sweep.\nAspect ratio in A350 - 9.03.\nWing area in A350 - 464.3 m2 (4,998 sq ft).\nOverall height in A350 - 17.08 m / 56 ft 0 in.\nFuselage in A350 - 5.96 m / 19.7 ft width, 6.09 m / 19.98 ft height.\nCabin width in A350 - 5.61 m / 18 ft 5 in.\nMTOW in A350 - 316 t / 696,661 lb.\nMax. payload in A350 - 64.2 t (142,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A350 - 158,791 L (41,948 US gal)124,651 kg (274,808 lb).\nOEW in A350 - 158.8 t (350,000 lb)155 t (342,000 lb) dry.\nMEW in A350 - 129 t (284,000 lb).\nCargo capacity in A350 - 44 LD3 or 14 pallets.\ncruise in A350 - Mach 0.85 (488 kn; 903 km/h) Typical, Mach 0.89 (513 kn; 950 km/h) Maximum.\nRange in A350 - 15,600 km (8,400 nmi).\nService ceiling in A350 - 41,450 ft (12,630 m).\nEngines (2\u00d7) in A350 - Rolls-Royce Trent XWB.\nMaximum thrust in A350 - 431.5 kN / 97,000 lbf.\nOverall length of A350 is 73.79 m.\nCabin length of A350 is 58.03 m.\nFuselage max diametr of A350 is 5.96 m.\nMax cabin width of A350 is 5.61 m.\nWingspan of A350 is 64.74 m.\nHeight of A350 is 17.08 m.\nTrack of A350 is 10.73 m .\nWheelbase of A350 is 32.48 m.\nTypical seating pax of A350 is 366.\nMax seating pax of A350 is 440.\nMax pallet number underfloor in freight type of A350 is 14.\nBulk hold volume in freight type of A350 is 11.30 m^3.\nTotal volume in freoght type of A350 is 208.20 m^3.\nRange of A350 is 15557 km.\nMmo if A350 is M0.89.\nMax ramp weight of A350 is 316.90 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A350 is 316 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A350 is 236 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A350 is 223 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A350 is 159000 litres.\nCockpit crew in A350-1000 - Two.\nSeating in A350-1000 - 366/369 (54B+315Y)387 (2-class).\nExit limit in A350-1000 - 440.\nOverall length in A350-1000 - 73.78 m / 242.7 ft.\nWing in A350-1000 - 64.75 m / 212.43 ft span, 31.9\u00b0 sweep.\nAspect ratio in A350-1000 - 9.03.\nWing area in A350-1000 - 464.3 m2 (4,998 sq ft).\nOverall height in A350-1000 - 17.08 m / 56 ft 0 in.\nFuselage in A350-1000 - 5.96 m / 19.7 ft width, 6.09 m / 19.98 ft height.\nCabin width in A350-1000 - 5.61 m / 18 ft 5 in.\nMTOW in A350-1000 - 316 t / 696,661 lb.\nMax. payload in A350-1000 - 64.2 t (142,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A350-1000 - 158,791 L (41,948 US gal)124,651 kg (274,808 lb).\nOEW in A350-1000 - 158.8 t (350,000 lb)155 t (342,000 lb) dry.\nMEW in A350-1000 - 129 t (284,000 lb).\nCargo capacity in A350-1000 - 44 LD3 or 14 pallets.\ncruise in A350-1000 - Mach 0.85 (488 kn; 903 km/h) Typical, Mach 0.89 (513 kn; 950 km/h) Maximum.\nRange in A350-1000 - 15,600 km (8,400 nmi).\nService ceiling in A350-1000 - 41,450 ft (12,630 m).\nEngines (2\u00d7) in A350-1000 - Rolls-Royce Trent XWB.\nMaximum thrust in A350-1000 - 431.5 kN / 97,000 lbf.\nOverall length of A350-1000 is 73.79 m.\nCabin length of A350-1000 is 58.03 m.\nFuselage max diametr of A350-1000 is 5.96 m.\nMax cabin width of A350-1000 is 5.61 m.\nWingspan of A350-1000 is 64.74 m.\nHeight of A350-1000 is 17.08 m.\nTrack of A350-1000 is 10.73 m .\nWheelbase of A350-1000 is 32.48 m.\nTypical seating pax of A350-1000 is 366.\nMax seating pax of A350-1000 is 440.\nMax pallet number underfloor in freight type of A350-1000 is 14.\nBulk hold volume in freight type of A350-1000 is 11.30 m^3.\nTotal volume in freoght type of A350-1000 is 208.20 m^3.\nRange of A350-1000 is 15557 km.\nMmo if A350-1000 is M0.89.\nMax ramp weight of A350-1000 is 316.90 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A350-1000 is 316 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A350-1000 is 236 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A350-1000 is 223 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A350-1000 is 159000 litres."}, {"title": "A350-900(A350).txt", "text": "A350-900:\n\nThe A350-900 is the first A350 model, has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 280 tonnes, typically seats 325 passengers, and has a range of 8,100 nmi (15,001 km). Airbus says that per seat, the Boeing 777-200ER should have a 16 percent heavier manufacturer's empty weight, a 30 percent higher block fuel consumption, and 25 percent higher cash operating costs than the A350-900. The \u2212900 is designed to compete with the Boeing 777 and 787 (777-200ER/LR, Boeing 777-8, and Boeing 787-10), while replacing the Airbus A340-300 and A340-500. A proposed A350\u2212900R extended-range variant was to feature the higher engine thrust, strengthened structure, and landing gear of the 308 tonnes MTOW -1000 to give a further 800 nmi (1,500 km) range. An A350\u2212900F freighter with a 5,000 nmi (9,260 km) range and a similar payload and volume to the 91.7 tonne and 440 m3 (16,000 cu ft) McDonnell Douglas MD-11F should be studied after the -1000 is done, depending on market demand. Philippine Airlines will replace its A340-300 with an A350-900HGW high gross weight version available from 2017. It will enable non-stop Manila-New York City flights without payload limitations in either direction, a 7,404 nmi (13,712 km) flight. The PAL version will have a 278 tonne MTOW, and from 2020, the -900 will be proposed with the ULR's 280 tonne MTOW, up from the 268 tonnes for the original weight variant and the certified 260, 272, and 275 tonne variants, with the large fuel capacity. This will enable a 8,100 nmi (15,001 km) range with 325 seats in a three-class layout. In early November 2017, Emirates committed to purchase 40 Boeing 787-10 aircraft before Airbus presented a picture-changing A350-900 layout with the rear pressure bulkhead pushed back by 2.5 ft (1 m). After Emirates' Tim Clark was shown a ten-abreast economy cabin and galley changes, he said the -900 is \"more marketable\" as a result. The average lease rates of the first A350-900s produced in 2014 were $1.1 million per month, not including maintenance reserves amounting to $18 million after 10\u201312 years, and falling to $940,000 per month in 2018 while a new A350-900 is leased for $1.2 million per month and its interior can cost $12 million, 10% of the aircraft.\n\nGoing the \u2018Xtra\u2019 distance, airbus launched the Ultra Long Range version of its A350-900 as part of the company\u2019s philosophy of continuous innovation. Designated the A350-900ULR, this jetliner can fly further than any other aircraft in commercial service \u2013 up to 9,700 nautical miles. Benefitting from the A350-900\u2019s unique flexibility, the extended range capability does not involve installation of additional fuel tanks, but rather an adaptation of the fuel system within the existing fuel tank. In addition, the A350-900ULR can be reconfigured to the standard long-haul specifications of the A350-900 if required by the operator. With a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 280 tonnes, the A350-900ULR is capable of flying over 20 hours non-stop, combining the highest levels of passenger and crew comfort with unbeatable economics for such distances.\nState-of-the-art travel, like all members of the A350 XWB Family, the A350-900 benefits from having the most modern cabin \u2013 delivering new standards of comfort to passengers throughout the flight. The advances made in the A350 XWB\u2019s cabin have led to development of the Airspace by Airbus concept, which delivers the perfect space for passenger well-being \u2013 exemplified by the A350 XWB \u2013 to the rest of Airbus\u2019 aircraft families. Passengers on the A350-900 can look forward to a spacious, elegantly-lit cabin as they settle into Airbus\u2019 wider seats for an enjoyable flight. The quietness of the cabin contributes to a relaxing environment, while the latest in-flight entertainment allows passengers to access movies on demand or stay-up-to-date with the world below thanks to Wi-Fi and mobile phone connectivity \u2013 whether it\u2019s for social media, replying to important business emails or something else.\nImpactful innovation, incorporating advances in flight controls, systems and wing design, the A350-900 is a truly state-of-the-art aircraft. These developments have a genuine impact in terms of safety, maintenance and efficiency, meaning that the aircraft reduces its fuel burn significantly \u2013 generating savings and reducing its environmental impact. As with all A350 XWB models, the fuselage is built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) \u2013 which supports lower fuel burn, easier maintenance and increased resistance to corrosion. The jetliner\u2019s wings also are more efficient and quieter due to their advanced design, which allows them to adapt while airborne \u2013 tailoring it for maximum aerodynamic efficiency in the various phases of flight.\n\nThe Airbus A350 XWB is a family of long-range, twin-engine wide-body jet airliners developed by European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre reinforced polymer. Its variants seat 280 to 366 passengers in typical three-class seating layouts. The A350 is positioned to succeed the A340 and to compete with the Boeing 787 and 777. The A350 was originally conceived in 2004 as a pairing of the A330's fuselage with new aerodynamics features and engines. In 2006, Airbus redesigned the aircraft in response to negative feedback from several major prospective customers, producing the \"A350 XWB\" (eXtra Wide Body). Development costs are estimated at \u20ac11 billion (US$15 billion or \u00a39.5 billion). As of June 2018, Airbus had received 882 orders for A350s from 45 customers worldwide. The prototype A350 first flew on 14 June 2013 from Toulouse, France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency was received in September 2014 and certification from the Federal Aviation Administration two months later. On 15 January 2015, the A350-900 entered service with its launch operator Qatar Airways, and the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same airline.\nThe most perfect designs often are found in nature. That\u2019s why Airbus looks to learn from the natural world when designing and improving upon its aircraft. As the newest member of the company\u2019s widebody family, the A350 XWB is an example of how this inspirational blend of science and nature represents another significant evolution in the ongoing mission to conceive and manufacture the perfect aircraft. The A350 XWB has learned from nature to help ensure a healthy future for the planet, whether it\u2019s the revolutionary adaptive wing design \u2013 inspired by birds \u2013 which morphs while airborne to achieve maximum aerodynamic efficiency by optimising wing loading, reducing drag and lowering fuel burn; or the savings generated by innovative technological advances. Designed with passengers and airlines at heart, the A350 XWB benefits from being built with over 70 per cent advanced materials; combining carbon composites (53 per cent), titanium and modern aluminium alloys, to create a lighter and more cost-efficient aircraft while also reducing maintenance requirements. The latest generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines are quieter and more efficient. The combination of these advantages result in 25 per cent lower operating costs, fuel burn and C02 emissions when compared with previous-generation aircraft \u2013 showing Airbus\u2019 commitment to protecting the environment while remaining at the cutting edge of air travel. \nIt\u2019s not only the technology that has been transformed. When Airbus designed the A350 XWB, a cabin was created that is so comfortable it revolutionised the approach to all of the company\u2019s aircraft interiors. As the founding member of the Airspace by Airbus cabin family, passengers on the A350 XWB can experience a feeling of on-board comfort like never before. The aircraft\u2019s innovative design delivers a feeling of spaciousness wherever you look, with wider seats, high ceilings and alluring ambient lighting. Airbus has produced the perfect environment in which to enjoy flying to any long-haul destination. The A350 XWB\u2019s cabin also is the quietest on a twin-aisle aircraft, and its advanced technology delivers the highest possible air quality with optimised cabin altitude (6000 ft), temperature and humidity, with the air being renewed every two-to-three minutes. Passengers can relax knowing that Airbus has thought of everything to ensure that they can arrive feeling fresh. Long journeys pass quickly with the latest-generation in-flight experience. Integrated connectivity lets passengers stay in touch with the rest of the world, while smart galleys and comfortable crew rest areas provide cabin crew with a pleasant working environment that makes it even easier to look after passengers.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this brilliantly-designed aircraft is one of the most versatile in the sky. The A350 XWB actually offers true long-range capability of up to 8,100 nautical miles, but can also be easily configured to operate both regional and ultra-long haul routes (up to 9,700nm), demonstrating its full operational flexibility. The A350 XWB also perfectly complements the A330 Family, offering significant advantages to airlines operating both aircraft. Whether it is in terms of route planning or the reduced training time for pilots familiar with A330 (thanks to the common type rating), a seamless integration of the two families is highly economical and proves the value of the A350 XWB\u2019s innovative design.\nAirbus initially rejected Boeing's claim that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be a serious threat to the Airbus A330, stating that the 787 was just a reaction to the A330 and that no response was needed. When airlines urged Airbus to provide a competitor, Airbus initially proposed the \"A330-200Lite\", a derivative of the A330 featuring improved aerodynamics and engines similar to those on the 787. The company planned to announce this version at the 2004 Farnborough Airshow, but did not proceed. On 16 September 2004, Airbus president and chief executive officer No\u00ebl Forgeard confirmed the consideration of a new project during a private meeting with prospective customers. Forgeard did not give a project name, and he did not state whether it would be an entirely new design or a modification of an existing product. Airline dissatisfaction with this proposal motivated Airbus to commit \u20ac4 billion to a new airliner design. The original version of the A350 superficially resembled the A330 due to its common fuselage cross-section and assembly. A new wing, engines, and a horizontal stabiliser\u2013to be coupled with new composite materials and production methods applied to the fuselage\u2013would make the A350 an almost all-new aircraft. On 10 December 2004, the boards of EADS and BAE Systems, then the shareholders of Airbus, gave Airbus an \"authorisation to offer\" (ATO) and formally named it the A350. On 13 June 2005 at the Paris Air Show, Middle Eastern carrier Qatar Airways announced that they had placed an order for 60 A350s. In September 2006 the airline signed a memorandum of understanding with General Electric to launch the GEnx-1A-72 engine for the aircraft. Emirates sought a more improved design and decided against ordering the initial version of the A350. On 6 October 2005, the programme's industrial launch was announced with an estimated development cost of around \u20ac3.5 billion. The A350 was initially planned to be a 250- to 300-seat twin-engine wide-body aircraft derived from the existing A330's design. Under this plan, the A350 would have modified wings and new engines while sharing the A330's fuselage cross-section. As a result of a controversial design, the fuselage was to consist primarily of aluminium-lithium rather than the carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) fuselage on the Boeing 787. The A350 would see entry in two versions: the A350-800 with a 8,800 nmi (16,300 km) range with a typical passenger capacity of 253 in a three-class configuration, and the A350-900 with 7,500 nmi (13,900 km) range and a 300-seat 3-class configuration. The A350 was designed to be a direct competitor to the Boeing 787-9 and 777-200ER. The A350 was publicly criticised by two of Airbus's largest customers, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). On 28 March 2006, ILFC President Steven F. Udvar-H\u00e1zy urged Airbus to pursue a clean-sheet design or risk losing market share to Boeing and branded Airbus's strategy as \"a Band-aid reaction to the 787\", a sentiment echoed by GECAS president Henry Hubschman. In April 2006, while reviewing bids for the Boeing 787 and A350, CEO of Singapore Airlines (SIA) Chew Choon Seng, commented that \"having gone through the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, cockpit... [Airbus] should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage.\" Airbus responded that they were considering A350 improvements to satisfy customer demands. Airbus's then-CEO Gustav Humbert stated, \"Our strategy isn't driven by the needs of the next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises.\" As major airlines such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines selected the 787 over the A350, Humbert tasked an engineering team to produce new alternative designs. One such proposal, known internally as \"1d\", formed the basis of the A350 redesign.\nOn 14 July 2006, during the Farnborough Airshow, the redesigned aircraft was designated \"A350 XWB\" (Xtra-Wide-Body). Within four days, Singapore Airlines agreed to order 20 A350XWBs with options for another 20 A350XWBs. The proposed A350 was a new design, including a wider fuselage cross-section, allowing seating arrangements ranging from an eight-abreast low-density premium economy layout to a ten-abreast high-density seating configuration for a maximum seating capacity of 440\u2013475 depending on variant. The A330 and previous iterations of the A350 would only be able to accommodate a maximum of eight seats per row. The 787 is typically configured for nine seats per row. The 777 accommodates nine or ten seats per row, with more than half of recent 777s being ten-abreast as the 777X will be. The A350 cabin is 12.7 cm (5.0 in) wider at the eye level of a seated passenger than the 787's cabin, and 28 cm (11 in) narrower than the Boeing 777's cabin. (See Wide-body aircraft for a comparison of cabin widths and seating.) All A350 passenger models will have a range of at least 8,000 nmi (14,816 km). The redesigned composite fuselage provides higher cabin pressure and humidity, and lower maintenance costs. On 1 December 2006, the Airbus board of directors approved the industrial launch of the A350-800, -900, and -1000 variants. The delayed launch decision was a result of delays of the Airbus A380 and discussions on how to fund development. EADS CEO Thomas Enders stated that the A350 programme was not a certainty, citing EADS/Airbus's stretched resources. However, it was decided programme costs are to be borne mainly from cash-flow. First delivery for the A350-900 was scheduled for mid-2013, with the -800 and -1000 following on 12 and 24 months later, respectively. New technical details of the A350 XWB were revealed at a press conference in December 2006. John Leahy indicated existing A350 contracts were being re-negotiated due to price increases compared to the original A350s contracted. On 4 January 2007, Pegasus Aviation Finance Company placed the first firm order for the A350 XWB with an order for two aircraft. The design change imposed a two-year delay into the original timetable and increased development costs from US$5.3 billion (\u20ac5.5 billion) to approximately US$10 billion (\u20ac9.7 billion). The total development cost for the A350 was estimated at US$15 billion by Reuters (\u20ac12 billion or \u00a310 billion). The original mid-2013 delivery date of the A350 changed, as a longer than anticipated development forced Airbus to delay the final assembly and first flight of the aircraft to the third quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2013 respectively. As a result, the flight test schedule was compressed from the original 15 months to 12 months. A350 programme chief Didier Evrard stressed that delays only affected the A350-900 while the -800 and -1000 schedules remained unchanged.\nAirbus suggested Boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the aircraft structure. The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes). Airbus used a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers. In 2006, Airbus confirmed development of a full bleed air system on the A350, as opposed to the 787's bleedless configuration. Rolls-Royce agreed with Airbus to supply a new variant of the Trent turbofan engine for the A350 XWB, named Trent XWB. In 2010, after low-speed wind tunnel tests, Airbus finalised the static thrust at sea level for all three proposed variants to the 330\u2013420 kN (74,000\u201394,000 lbf) range. General Electric (GE) stated it would not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that previous contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 did not apply to the XWB. Engine Alliance partner Pratt & Whitney seemed to be at odds with GE on this, having publicly stating that it was looking at an advanced derivative of the GP7000. In April 2007, Airbus former chief executive Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB. In June 2007, Airbus's chief operating officer John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to offer a more efficient version for the airliner. Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it can offer a product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants. In January 2008, French-based Thales Group won a US$2.9 billion (\u20ac2 billion) 20-year contract to supply avionics and navigation equipment for the A350 XWB, beating Honeywell and Rockwell Collins. US-based Rockwell Collins and Moog Inc were chosen to supply the horizontal stabiliser actuator and primary flight control actuation, respectively. The flight management system incorporated several new safety features. Regarding cabin ergonomics and entertainment, in 2006 Airbus signed a firm contract with BMW for development of an interior concept for the original A350. On 4 February 2010, Airbus signed a contract with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to deliver in-flight entertainment and communication (IFEC) systems for the Airbus A350 XWB.\nIn 2008, Airbus planned to introduce new techniques and procedures to cut assembly time in half. The A350 XWB production programme sees extensive international collaboration and investments in new facilities: Airbus constructed 10 new factories in Western Europe and the US, with extensions carried out on 3 further sites. Among the new buildings was a \u00a3570 million (US$760 million or \u20ac745 million) composite facility in Broughton, Wales, which would be responsible for the wings. In June 2009, the National Assembly for Wales announced provision of a \u00a328 million grant to provide a training centre, production jobs and money toward the new production centre. Airbus manufactured the first structural component in December 2009. Production of the first fuselage barrel began in late 2010 at its production plant in Illescas, Spain. Construction of the first A350-900 centre wingbox was set to start in August 2010. The new composite rudder plant in China opened in early 2011. The forward fuselage of the first A350 was delivered to the final assembly plant in Toulouse on 29 December 2011. Final assembly of the first A350 static test model was started on 5 April 2012. Final assembly of the first prototype A350 was completed in December 2012. The production rate was expected to rise from three aircraft per month in early 2015 to five at the end of 2015, and would ramp to ten aircraft per month by 2018. In 2015, 17 planes would be delivered and the initial dispatch reliability was 98%. Airbus plans to increase its production rate from 10 monthly in 2018 to 13 monthly from 2019, while the Boeing 787 production will increase from 12 to 14 per month in 2019, and six A330 are produced monthly. Around 90 deliveries are expected in 2018, with about 15% -1000s (\u224814).\nThe first Trent engine test was made on 14 June 2010. The Trent XWB's flight test programme began use on the A380 development aircraft in early 2011, ahead of engine certification in late 2011. On 2 June 2013, the Trent XWB engines were powered up on the A350 for the first time. Airbus confirmed that the flight test programme would last 12 months and use five test aircraft. The A350's maiden flight took place on 14 June 2013 from the Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport. Airbus's chief test pilot said, \"it just seemed really happy in the air...all the things we were testing had no major issues at all.\" It flew for 4 hours, reaching Mach .8 at 25,000 feet after retracting the landing gear and starting a 2,500 h flight test campaign. A350 XWB, F-WWCF, msn. 2, underwent two-and-a-half weeks of climatic tests in the unique McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in May 2014, and was subjected to multiple climatic and humidity settings from a high of 45 \u00b0C to as low as -40 \u00b0C. The A350 received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 30 September 2014. On 15 October 2014, EASA approved the A350-900 for ETOPS 370, allowing it to fly more than six hours on one engine and making it the first airliner to be approved for \"ETOPS Beyond 180 minutes\" before entry into service. Later that month Airbus received regulatory approval for a Common Type Rating for pilot training between the A350 XWB and A330. On 12 November 2014, the A350 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration.\nIn June 2011, the A350-900 was scheduled to enter service in the first half of 2014, with the -800 to enter service in mid-2016, and the -1000 in 2017. In July 2012, Airbus delayed the -900's introduction by three months to the second half of 2014. The first delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways took place on 22 December 2014. The first commercial flight was made on 15 January 2015 between Doha and Frankfurt. One year after introduction, the A350 fleet had accumulated 3,000 cycles and around 16,000 flight hours. Average daily usage by first customers was 11.4 hours with flights averaging 5.2 hours, which are under the aircraft's capabilities and reflect both short flights within the schedules of Qatar Airways and Vietnam Airlines, as well as flight-crew proficiency training that is typical of early use and is accomplished on short-haul flights. Finnair was operating the A350 at very high rates: 15 flight hours per day for Beijing, 18 hours for Shanghai, and more than 20 hours for Bangkok. This may have accelerated its retirement of the Airbus A340. In service problems had included three areas. The onboard Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul network needed software improvements. Airbus issued service bulletins regarding onboard equipment and removed galley inserts (coffee makers, toaster ovens) because of leaks. Airbus had to address spurious overheating warnings in the bleed air system by retrofitting an original connector with a gold-plated connector. Airbus targeted a 98.5 percent dependability by the end of 2016 and to match the mature A330 reliability by early 2019. By the end of May 2016, the in-service fleet had flown 55,200 hours over 9,400 cycles at a 97.8 percent operational reliability on three months. The longest operated sector was Qatar Airways' Adelaide\u2013Doha at 13.8 hours for 6,120 nmi (11,334 km). 45 percent of flights were under 3,000 nmi (5,556 km), 16 percent over 5,000 nmi (9,260 km), and 39 percent in between. The average flight was 6.8 hours, with the longest average being 9.6 hours by TAM Airlines and the shortest being 2.1 hours by Cathay Pacific's. Aircraft seat configuration ranged from 253 seats for Singapore Airlines to 348 seats for TAM Airlines, with a 30 to 46 seat business class and a 211 to 318 seat economy class, often including a premium economy. The first A350-1000 was assembled in 2016, for a first flight on 24 November and entry into service planned for mid-2017. In January 2017, two years after introduction, 62 aircraft were in service with 10 airlines. They had accumulated 25,000 flights over 154,000 hours with an average daily utilisation of 12.5 hours, and transported six million passengers with a 98.7 percent operational reliability. Zodiac Aerospace had business class seats production difficulties in its Gainesville, Texas and Santa Maria, California factories. After a year, Cathay Pacific experienced cosmetic quality issues and upgraded or replaced the seats for the earliest cabins. In 2017, average test flights before delivery decreased to 4.1 from 12 in 2014, with an average delay down to 25 days from 68. Its reliability was 97.2 percent in 2015, 98.3 percent in 2016, and 98.8 percent in June 2017, just behind its 99 percent target for 2017. In June 2017 after 30 months in commercial operation, 80 A350 were in service with 12 operators, the largest being Qatar Airways with 17 and 13 each at Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines (SIA). The fleet average block time was 7.2 hours with 53 percent below 3,000 nmi (5,556 km), 16 percent over 5,000 nmi (9,260 km), and 31 percent in between. LATAM Airlines had the longest average sector at 10.7 hours, and Asiana had the shortest at 3.8 hours. Singapore Airlines operated the longest leg, Singapore to San Francisco 7,340 nmi (13,594 km), and the shortest leg, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur 160 nmi (296 km). In 2016, 49 were delivered and the monthly rate should grow to 10 by the end of 2018. Seating varied from 253 for Singapore Airlines to 389 for Air Cara\u00efbes, with most between 280 and 320. In October 2017, Airbus was testing extended sharklets, which could offer 100\u2013140 nmi (185\u2013259 km) extra range and reduce fuel burn by 1.4\u20131.6 percent. The wing twist is being changed for the wider, optimised spanload pressure distribution, and they will be used for the Singapore Airlines A350-900ULR in 2018 before spreading to other variants. Iberia will be the first to get the upgraded -900 in June 2018, with a 280 t (617,294 lb) MTOW version for a 8,200 nmi (15,186 km) range with 325 passengers in three classes. As of February 2018, 142 -900 had been delivered, with a dispatch reliability of 99.3 percent.\nIn September 2007, Airbus rolled out new design advances to a gathering of 100 representatives from existing and potential XWB customers. The A350 XWB is based on the technologies developed for the Airbus A380 and includes a similar cockpit and fly-by-wire systems layout. Airbus expects 10 percent lower airframe maintenance compared with the original A350 design and 14 percent lower empty seat weight than the Boeing 777. Design freeze for the A350-900 was achieved in December 2008.\nThe A350 XWB airframe will be made out of 53 percent composites: carbon fibre reinforced plastic for the outer and centre wing box (covers, stringers, spars), fuselage (skin, frame, keel beam, and rear fuselage) and the empennage (horizontal and vertical tailplanes); 19 percent aluminium and aluminium-lithium alloy for ribs, floor beams, and gear bays; 14 percent titanium for landing gears, pylons, and attachments; 6 percent steel; and 8 percent miscellaneous. The A350's competitor, the Boeing 787, is 50 percent composites, 20 percent aluminium, 15 percent titanium, 10 percent steel, and 5 percent other.\nThe A350 XWB fuselage has a constant width from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous Airbus aircraft, to provide maximum usable volume. The double-lobe (ovoid) fuselage cross-section has a maximum outer diameter of 5.97 m (19.6 ft), compared to 5.64 m (18.5 ft) for the A330/A340. The cabin's internal width is 5.61 m (18.4 ft) at armrest level compared to 5.49 m (18.0 ft) in the Boeing 787 and 5.87 m (19.3 ft) in the Boeing 777. It allows for an eight-abreast 2\u20134\u20132 arrangement in a premium economy layout, with the seats being 49.5 cm (19.5 in) wide between 5 cm (2.0 in) wide arm rests. Airbus says that the seat will be 1.3 cm (0.5 in) wider than a 787 seat in the equivalent configuration. In the nine-abreast, 3\u20133\u20133 standard economy layout, the A350 seat will be 45 cm (18 in) wide, 1.27 cm (0.5 in) wider than a seat in the equivalent layout in the 787, and 3.9 cm (1.5 in) wider than a seat in the equivalent A330 layout. The current 777 and future derivatives have 1.27 cm (0.5 in) greater seat width than the A350 in a nine-abreast configuration. The 10-abreast seating on the A350 is similar to a 9-abreast configuration on the A330, with a seat width of 41.65 cm (16.4 in). Overall, Airbus promises passengers more headroom, larger overhead storage space, and wider panoramic windows than current Airbus models. The A350 nose section has a configuration derived from the A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen. This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original design. The new nose improves aerodynamics and enables overhead crew rest areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing the width of the centre post. The upper shell radius of the nose section has been increased. The nose is likely to be constructed from aluminium but Airbus is currently running trade-off studies considering a one-piece carbon fibre structure. According to Gordon McConnell, A350 Chief Engineer, a carbon fibre structure would need titanium reinforcements for birdstrike protection, thus the aluminium structure is the best cost-wise.\nAirbus adopted a new philosophy for the attachment of the A350's main undercarriage as part of the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10. Airbus devised a three-pronged main undercarriage design philosophy encompassing both four- and six-wheel bogies to ensure it can keep the pavement loading within limits. The A350-900 will have four-wheel bogies in a 4.1 m (13 ft) long bay. The higher weight variant, the A350-1000 will use a six-wheel bogie, with a 4.7 m (15 ft) undercarriage bay. French-based Messier-Dowty will provide the main undercarriage for the -900 variant, and UTC Aerospace Systems will supply the \u22121000 variant. The nose gear will be supplied by Liebherr Aerospace.\nThe A350 features new composite wings with a wingspan that is common to the proposed variants. Its 64.75 m (212.4 ft) wingspan stays within the same ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code E 65m limit as the A330/A340, and the Boeing 777. The A350's wing has a 31.9\u00b0 sweep angle for a Mach 0.85 cruise speed and have a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.89. The -900 wing covers a 442 m2 (4,760 sq ft) area. This is between the 436.8 m2 (4,702 sq ft) wing of the current Boeing 777-200LR/300ER and the 466.8 m2 (5,025 sq ft) wing of the in-development Boeing 777X. However, Boeing and Airbus doesn't have the same measurement area. The A350-1000 wing is 22.3m\u00b2 (240 ft\u00b2) larger through a 30 cm (12 in) extension to the inboard sections of the fixed trailing edge. A new trailing-edge high-lift device has been adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap similar to that of the Airbus A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect differentially. The manufacturer has extensively used computational fluid dynamics and also carried out more than 4,000 hours of low- and high-speed windtunnel testing to refine the aerodynamic design. The final configuration of wing and winglet was achieved for the \"Maturity Gate 5\" on 17 December 2008. The wingtip device curves upwards over the final 4.4 m (14 ft). The wings are produced in the new \u00a3400M, 46,000 m2 (500,000 sq ft) North Factory at Airbus Broughton, employing 650 workers, in a specialist facility constructed with \u00a329M of support from the Welsh Government.\nThe revised design of the A350 XWB's glass cockpit dropped the A380-sized display and adopted 38 cm (15 in) liquid-crystal display screens. The new six-screen configuration includes two central displays mounted one above the other (the lower one above the thrust levers) and a single (for each pilot) primary flight/navigation display, with an adjacent on-board information system screen. Airbus says the cockpit design allows for future advances in navigation technology to be placed on the displays plus gives flexibility and capacity to upload new software and to combine data from multiple sources and sensors for flight management and aircraft systems control. A head-up display is also present in the cockpit. The avionics is a further development of the integrated modular avionics (IMA) concept found on the A380. The A350's IMA will manage up to 40 functions (versus 23 functions for the A380) such as undercarriage, fuel, pneumatics, cabin environmental systems, and fire detection. Airbus stated that the benefits includes reduced maintenance and lower weight because as the IMA replaces multiple processors and LRUs with around 50 percent fewer standard computer modules known as line-replaceable modules. The IMA runs on a 100 Mbit/s network based on the AFDX standard, as employed in the A380, in place of the architecture used on the A330/A340.\nThe Rolls-Royce Trent XWB feature a 118 in (300 cm) fan disk diameter and the design will be based on the advanced developments of the Airbus A380 Trent 900 and the Boeing 787 Trent 1000. It has two thrust levels to power the A350 variants: a 84,000 lbf (370 kN) for the A350-900 and a 97,000 lbf (430 kN) for the A350-1000. The higher-thrust version will have some modifications to the fan module\u2014it will be the same diameter but will run slightly faster and have a new fan blade design\u2014and run at increased temperatures allowed by new materials technologies from Rolls-Royce's research. The Trent XWB may also benefit from the next-generation reduced acoustic mode scattering engine duct system (RAMSES), an acoustic quieting engine nacelle intake, and a carry-on design of the Airbus's \"zero splice\" intake liner developed for the A380. A \"hot and high\" rating option for Middle Eastern customers Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways keep its thrust available at higher temperatures and altitudes. Airbus is aiming to certify the A350 with 350-minute ETOPS capability on entry into service. That could reach 420 min later, although Airbus achieved a 370\u2013minute ETOPS rating on 15 October 2014 which covers 99.7% of the Earth's surface. Engine thrust-reversers and nacelles will be supplied by US-based UTC Aerospace Systems.\nHoneywell supplies its 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) HGT1700 auxiliary power unit with 10 percent greater power density than the TPE331 from which it is developed, and the air management system: the bleed air, environmental control, cabin pressure control and supplemental cooling systems. Airbus says that the new design provides a better cabin atmosphere with 20 percent humidity, a typical cabin altitude at or below 6,000 ft (1,800 m) and an airflow management system that adapts cabin airflow to passenger load with draught-free air circulation. The ram air turbine, capable of generating 100 kilovolt-ampere, is supplied by Hamilton Sundstrand and located in the lower surface of the fuselage. In light of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems, in February 2013 Airbus decided to revert from lithium-ion to the proven nickel-cadmium technology although the flight test programme will continue with the lithium-ion battery systems. In late 2015, MSN24 was delivered with 176 lb (80 kg) lighter Saft Li-ion batteries and in June 2017, fifty A350s were flying with them and benefiting from a two-year maintenance schedule instead of NiCd\u2019s 4\u20136 months. Parker Hannifin supplies the complete fuel package: inerting system, fuel measurement and management systems, mechanical equipment and fuel pumps. The fuel tank inerting system features air-separation modules to generate nitrogen-enriched air to reduce the flammability of fuel vapour in the tanks. Parker also provides hydraulic power generation and distribution system: reservoirs, manifolds, accumulators, thermal control, isolation, software and new engine- and electric motor-driven pump designs. Parker estimates the contracts will generate more than $2 billion in revenues over the life of the programme.\nVariants: the three main variants of the A350 were launched in 2006, with entry into service planned for 2013. At the 2011 Paris Air Show, Airbus postponed the entry into service of the A350-1000 by two years to mid-2017. In July 2012, the A350's entry into service was delayed to the second half of 2014, before the -900 began service on 15 January 2015. In October 2012, the -800 was due to enter service in mid-2016, but its development has been cancelled since September 2014. The A350 is also offered as the ACJ350 corporate jet by Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), offering a 20,000 km (10,800 nmi) range for 25 passengers for the -900 derivative.\nA350-900ULR:\nThe MTOW of the ultra-long range -900ULR is being increased to 280 t (620,000 lb) and its fuel capacity from 141,000 to 165,000 l (37,000 to 44,000 US gal) within existing fuel tanks, enabling up to 19-hour flights with a 9,700 nmi (18,000 km) range. The MTOW is increased by 5 tonnes from the previously certified 275 tonnes variant. Because the A350-900's fuel consumption is 5.8 tonnes/hour, it needs an additional 24 tonnes of fuel to fly 19 hours instead of the standard 15 hours: the increased MTOW and lower payloads will enable the larger fuel capacity. Non-stop flights could last more than 20 hours. The first \u2212900ULR was rolled out without its engines in February 2018 for ground testing, and debuted flight-tests after engine installation to check the larger fuel capacity and to measure the performance improvements from the extended winglets. It made its first flight on 23 April 2018. Singapore Airlines, the launch customer, will use its seven -900ULR aircraft on non-stop flights between Singapore and New York City, and cities on the U.S. west coast. Singapore Airlines' seating is to be from 170 in largely business class seating up to over 250 in mixed seating. The planes can be reconfigured. They will have two seating classes. The airline received its first -900ULR on 23 September 2018, with 67 business class seats and 94 premier economy seats. On 12 October, it landed the world's longest flight in New York/Newark from Singapore Changi after 17 h 52 mn. The flight covered 16,562 km (8,943 nmi) for a 15,353 km (8,290 nmi) orthodromic distance. It burned 101.4 t (224,000 lb) of fuel to cover the route in 17h22m: an average of 5.8 t/h. At the 2015 Dubai Air Show, Airbus's John Leahy noted the appetite of the Middle East gulf airlines for this variant. In February 2018, Qatar Airways expressed no interest in the -900ULR. Compared to the standard -900, the -900ULR additional value is likely around $2 million.\nACJ350:\nAirbus Corporate Jet version of the A350, the ACJ350, is derived from the A350-900ULR. As a result of the increased fuel capacity from the -900ULR, the ACJ350 has a maximum range of 20,000 km (10,800 nmi).\nA350 Regional:\t\nAfter the Boeing 787-10 launch at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Airbus discussed with airlines a possible A350-900 Regional with a reduced MTOW of 250 tonnes and engine thrust reduced to 70,000-75,000 lb (from the standard 85,000 lb). The variant was said to be optimised for routes up to 6,800 nmi (12,594 km) with seating for up to 360 passengers in a single-class layout. Etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines were said to be ordering the A350 Regional. Since 2013, there has been no further announcement about this variant.\nAirbus has explored the possibility of a further stretch offering 45 more seats. A potential 4 m stretch would remain within the exit limit of four door pairs, and a modest MTOW increase from 308 t to 319 t would need only 3% more thrust, within the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 capabilities, and would allow a 14,100 km (7,600 nmi) range to compete with the Boeing 777-9 capabilities. This variant was to be a replacement for the Boeing 747-400, tentatively dubbed the A350-8000, -2000 or -1100. Within the June 2016 Airbus Innovation Days, chief commercial officer John Leahy was concerned about the size of a 400-seat market besides the Boeing 747-8 and the 777-9 and chief executive Fabrice Br\u00e9gier feared such an aircraft could cannibalise demand for the -1000. The potential 79 m-long (258 ft) airplane was competing against a hypothetical 777-10X for Singapore Airlines. At the 2017 Paris Air Show, the concept was shelved for lacking market appeal and in January 2018 Fabrice Br\u00e9gier focused on enhancing the A350-900/1000 to capture potential before 2022/2023, when it will be possible to stretch the A350 with a new engine generation.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCockpit crew in A350 - Two.\nSeating in A350 - 325/315 (48B+267Y)ULR: 173=80J+93Y.\nExit limit in A350 - 440.\nOverall length in A350 - 66.8 m / 219.5 ft.\nWing in A350 - 64.75 m / 212.43 ft span, 31.9\u00b0 sweep.\nAspect ratio in A350 - 9.49.\nWing area in A350 - 442 m2 (4,760 sq ft).\nOverall height in A350 - 17.05 m / 55 ft 11 in.\nFuselage in A350 - 5.96 m / 19.7 ft width, 6.09 m / 19.98 ft height.\nCabin width in A350 - 5.61 m / 18 ft 5 in.\nMTOW in A350 - 280 t / 617,295 lb.\nMax. payload in A350 - 53.3 t (118,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A350 - 140,795 L (37,194 US gal)110,523 kg (243,662 lb).\nOEW in A350 - 142.4 t (314,000 lb) typical134.7\u2013145.1 t (297,000\u2013320,000 lb).\nMEW in A350 - 115.7 t (255,075 lb).\nCargo capacity in A350 - 36 LD3 or 11 pallets.\ncruise in A350 - Mach 0.85 (488 kn; 903 km/h) Typical, Mach 0.89 (513 kn; 950 km/h) Maximum.\nRange in A350 - 15,000 km / 8,100 nmi.\nTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A350 - 2,600 m (8,500 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A350 - 2,000 m (6,600 ft).\nService ceiling in A350 - 43,100 ft (13,100 m).\nEngines (2\u00d7) in A350 - Rolls-Royce Trent XWB.\nMaximum thrust in A350 - 374.5 kN / 84,200 lbf.\nOverall length of A350 is 66.8 m.\nCabin length of A350 is 51.04 m.\nFuselage max diametr of A350 is 5.96 m.\nMax cabin width of A350 is 5.61 m.\nWingspan of A350 is 64.75 m.\nHeight of A350 is 17.05 m.\nTrack of A350 is 10.6 m.\nWheelbase of A350 is 28.66 m.\nTypical seating pax of A350 is 325.\nMax seating pax of A350 is 440.\nLD3 capacity underfloor in freight type of A350 is 36.\nMax pallet number underfloor in freight type of A350 is 11.\nBulk hold volume in freight type of A350 is 11.3 m^3.\nTotal volume(Bulk loading) in freight type of A350 is 172.4 m^3.\nRange of A350 is 15000 km.\nMmo if A350 is M0.89.\nMax ramp weight of A350 is 280.90 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A350 is 280.00 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A350 is 207.00 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A350 is 195.70 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A350 is 141000 litres.\nCockpit crew in A350-900 - Two.\nSeating in A350-900 - 325/315 (48B+267Y)ULR: 173=80J+93Y.\nExit limit in A350-900 - 440.\nOverall length in A350-900 - 66.8 m / 219.5 ft.\nWing in A350-900 - 64.75 m / 212.43 ft span, 31.9\u00b0 sweep.\nAspect ratio in A350-900 - 9.49.\nWing area in A350-900 - 442 m2 (4,760 sq ft).\nOverall height in A350-900 - 17.05 m / 55 ft 11 in.\nFuselage in A350-900 - 5.96 m / 19.7 ft width, 6.09 m / 19.98 ft height.\nCabin width in A350-900 - 5.61 m / 18 ft 5 in.\nMTOW in A350-900 - 280 t / 617,295 lb.\nMax. payload in A350-900 - 53.3 t (118,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A350-900 - 140,795 L (37,194 US gal)110,523 kg (243,662 lb).\nOEW in A350-900 - 142.4 t (314,000 lb) typical134.7\u2013145.1 t (297,000\u2013320,000 lb).\nMEW in A350-900 - 115.7 t (255,075 lb).\nCargo capacity in A350-900 - 36 LD3 or 11 pallets.\ncruise in A350-900 - Mach 0.85 (488 kn; 903 km/h) Typical, Mach 0.89 (513 kn; 950 km/h) Maximum.\nRange in A350-900 - 15,000 km / 8,100 nmi.\nTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A350-900 - 2,600 m (8,500 ft).\nLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A350-900 - 2,000 m (6,600 ft).\nService ceiling in A350-900 - 43,100 ft (13,100 m).\nEngines (2\u00d7) in A350-900 - Rolls-Royce Trent XWB.\nMaximum thrust in A350-900 - 374.5 kN / 84,200 lbf.\nOverall length of A350-900 is 66.8 m.\nCabin length of A350-900 is 51.04 m.\nFuselage max diametr of A350-900 is 5.96 m.\nMax cabin width of A350-900 is 5.61 m.\nWingspan of A350-900 is 64.75 m.\nHeight of A350-900 is 17.05 m.\nTrack of A350-900 is 10.6 m.\nWheelbase of A350-900 is 28.66 m.\nTypical seating pax of A350-900 is 325.\nMax seating pax of A350-900 is 440.\nLD3 capacity underfloor in freight type of A350-900 is 36.\nMax pallet number underfloor in freight type of A350-900 is 11.\nBulk hold volume in freight type of A350-900 is 11.3 m^3.\nTotal volume(Bulk loading) in freight type of A350-900 is 172.4 m^3.\nRange of A350-900 is 15000 km.\nMmo if A350-900 is M0.89.\nMax ramp weight of A350-900 is 280.90 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A350-900 is 280.00 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A350-900 is 207.00 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A350-900 is 195.70 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A350-900 is 141000 litres."}, {"title": "A380.txt", "text": "A380:\n\nThe Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner, and the airports at which it operates have upgraded facilities to accommodate it. It was initially named Airbus A3XX and designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large-aircraft market. The A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service on 25 October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. An improved version, the A380plus, is under development. The A380's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage; it is narrower than the lower deck but remains comparable to the width of other wide-body aircraft. This gives the A380-800's cabin 550 square metres (5,920 sq ft) of usable floor space, 40% more than the next largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8, and provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration. The A380-800 has a design range of 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km), serving the fourth- and seventh-longest non-stop scheduled flights in the world, and a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (about 900 km/h, 560 mph or 490 kt at cruising altitude). As of September 2018, Airbus had received 331 firm orders and delivered 230 aircraft; Emirates is the biggest A380 customer with 162 ordered of which 105 have been delivered.\nThe A380\u2019s service introduction ushered in a new era of airline transportation for operators. Whether it\u2019s being used to reduce the number of flights and create cost savings while maintaining capacity, or to offer more capacity with fewer takeoff slots, the A380 brings operators a wide range of commercial advantages. Furthermore, with two full-length decks, more space for every passenger, and a flying experience no other aircraft in the sky can match, the A380 has become a must-have ticket on every route it flies \u2013 resulting in a significant first-mover advantage for operators.\nThe A380\u2019s cockpit \u2013 which is based on Airbus\u2019 industry-leading flight deck design for its fly-by-wire jetliner families \u2013 features the latest advances in cockpit technology, including larger interactive displays, an advanced flight management system and improved navigation modes. The A380's main instrument panel incorporates eight identical and interchangeable Liquid Crystal Display Units, providing a primary flight display, navigation display, two multi-function displays, an engine warning display and a systems display. The increased display size provides increased perspective for pilots and allows for enhanced presentation modes as a vertical situation awareness function that presents a \u201cvertical cut\u201d of the aircraft trajectory incorporating flight path, terrain and weather information. A key A380 innovation is the use of an electronic library to largely replace the traditional paper documentation used by pilots. This library allows flight and maintenance crews to easily locate relevant operational information in the various flight manuals, lists and logbooks, while enabling an optimisation of performance and weight-and-balance computations.\nAirbus introduced its innovative Brake to Vacate technology on the A380, allowing flight crews to more effectively manage approach and landing by pre-selecting the optimum runway exit. This can reduce runway occupancy time by up to 30 per cent \u2013 significantly increasing the number of aircraft that can be handled by the world\u2019s airports.\nBy incorporating the latest advances in structures and materials, the A380 offers the lowest cost per seat of any widebody aircraft, over 15 per cent lower than its nearest competitor. This includes the use of advanced aluminium alloys for the wing and fuselage, along with the extensive application of composite materials in the centre wing box\u2019s primary structure, wing ribs, and rear fuselage section. The A380 also uses Glare\u2122 material in the pressurised fuselage\u2019s upper and lateral shells. Glare\u2122 is a laminate incorporating alternate layers of aluminium alloy and glass fibre reinforced adhesive, with its properties optimised by adjusting the number of plies and orientation of the glass tapes. This offers a significant reduction in weight and provides advanced fatigue and damage resistance characteristics.\nTwo new-generation engine options (the Engine Alliance GP7200 and Rolls-Royce Trent 900), combined with an advanced wing and landing gear design, make the A380 significantly quieter than today's largest airliner \u2013 enabling this very large aircraft to meet strict local regulations at airports around the world. With a new wing design and composite materials accounting for 25 per cent of its structural weight, the A380 is the most efficient aircraft all around. By producing only about 75 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometre, the A380 is helping the aviation industry's commitment to minimise greenhouse gas emissions. A380 reliability and maintainability is further increased with modern technology, including an enhanced onboard central maintenance system and variable frequency generators \u2013 which simplify the large aircraft\u2019s electrical generation network. Hydraulic power is provided by two fully independent systems with an operating pressure of 5,000 psi., instead of the conventional 3,000 psi. This capacity for higher pressure results in smaller and lighter hydraulic system equipment, as well as less hydraulic fluid on board, proving how Airbus innovations continue to deliver efficiency in every area of aircraft design and manufacture.\nIn mid-1988, Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began work in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747. McDonnell Douglas unsuccessfully offered its smaller, double-deck MD-12 concept for sale. Roeder was given approval for further evaluations of the UHCA after a formal presentation to the President and CEO in June 1990. The megaproject was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, with the stated goal of 15% lower operating costs than the 747-400. Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners (A\u00e9rospatiale, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace AG, CASA) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs. The designs were presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs were used. In January 1993, Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT), aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market. This joint study was abandoned two years later, Boeing's interest having declined because analysts thought that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $15 billion development cost. Despite the fact that only two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane, Airbus was already pursuing its own large-plane project. Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design, and that air travel was already moving away from the hub-and-spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes, and toward more non-stop routes that could be served by smaller planes. In June 1994, Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner, designated as A3XX. Airbus considered several designs, including an unusual side-by-side combination of two fuselages from its A340, the largest Airbus jet at the time. The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing's own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747. From 1997 to 2000, as the East Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook, Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15\u201320% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747\u2013400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design, in line with traditional hub-and-spoke theory as opposed to the point-to-point theory with the Boeing 777, after conducting an extensive market analysis with over 200 focus groups. Although early marketing of the huge cross-section touted the possibility of duty-free shops, restaurant-like dining, gyms, casinos and beauty parlours on board, the realities of airline economics have kept such dreams grounded. On 19 December 2000, the supervisory board of newly restructured Airbus voted to launch an \u20ac8.8-billion programme to build the A3XX, re-designated as the A380, with 50 firm orders from six launch customers. The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families, which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340. It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double-deck cross section, and is a lucky number in some Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed. The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001, and manufacturing of the first A380 wing-box component started on 23 January 2002. The development cost of the A380 had grown to \u20ac11\u201314 billion when the first aircraft was completed.\nIn 2000, the originally projected development cost was \u20ac9.5 billion. In 2004 Airbus estimated 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) would be added for a \u20ac10.3 Bn ($12.7 Bn) total. In 2006 at \u20ac10.2 Billion, Airbus stopped publishing its reported cost and then provisioned \u20ac4.9 Bn after the difficulties in electric cabling and two years delay for an estimated total of \u20ac18 Bn. In 2014, the aircraft was estimated to have cost $25bn (\u00a316bn \u2013 \u20ac18.9bn) to develop. In 2015, Airbus said development costs were \u20ac15bn (\u00a311.4bn \u2013 $16.95 Bn), though analysts believe the figure is likely to be at least \u20ac5bn ($5.65 Bn) more for a \u20ac20 Bn ($22.6 Bn) total. In 2016, The A380 development costs were estimated at $25 billion for 15 years, $25\u201330 billion, or 25 billion euros ($28 billion). To start the program in 2000, Germany, France and the U.K. loaned Airbus 3.5 billion euros and refundable advances reached 5.9 billion euros ($7.3 billion). In February 2018, after an Emirates order secured production of the unprofitable program for ten years, Airbus revised its deal with these countries to save $1.4 billion (17%): restructured terms allow to lower the production rate from eight in 2019 to six per year.\nMajor structural sections of the A380 are built in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Due to the sections' large size, traditional transportation methods proved unfeasible, so they are brought to the Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re Plant assembly hall in Toulouse, France, by specialised road and water transportation, though some parts are moved by the A300-600ST Beluga transport aircraft. A380 components are provided by suppliers from around the world; the four largest contributors, by value, are Rolls-Royce, Safran, United Technologies and General Electric. For the surface movement of large A380 structural components, a complex route known as the Itin\u00e9raire \u00e0 Grand Gabarit was developed. This involved the construction of a fleet of roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships and barges, the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys. The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to the United Kingdom. The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales, then transported by barge to Mostyn docks for ship transport. In Saint-Nazaire in western France, the ship exchanges the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. The ship unloads in Bordeaux. The ship then picks up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA in C\u00e1diz in southern Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse. In order to avoid damage from direct handling, parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self-powered wheeled vehicles. After assembly, the aircraft are flown to Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (XFW) to be furnished and painted. Airbus sized the production facilities and supply chain for a production rate of four A380s per month.\nFive A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes. The first A380, registered F-WWOW, was unveiled in Toulouse 18 January 2005. It first flew on 27 April 2005. This plane, equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, flew from Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport with a crew of six headed by chief test pilot Jacques Rosay. Rosay said flying the A380 had been \"like handling a bicycle\". On 1 December 2005, the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach 0.96, (its design cruise speed is Mach 0.85) in a shallow dive. In 2006, the A380 flew its first high-altitude test at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. It conducted its second high-altitude test at the same airport in 2009. On 10 January 2006, it flew to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport in Colombia, accomplishing the transatlantic testing, and then it went to El Dorado International Airport to test the engine operation in high-altitude airports. It arrived in North America on 6 February 2006, landing in Iqaluit, Nunavut in Canada for cold-weather testing. On 14 February 2006, during the destructive wing strength certification test on MSN5000, the test wing of the A380 failed at 145% of the limit load, short of the required 150% level. Airbus announced modifications adding 30 kg (66 lb) to the wing to provide the required strength. On 26 March 2006, the A380 underwent evacuation certification in Hamburg. With 8 of the 16 exits arbitrarily blocked, 853 mixed passengers and 20 crew exited the darkened aircraft in 78 seconds, less than the 90 seconds required for certification. Three days later, the A380 received European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to carry up to 853 passengers. The first A380 using GP7200 engines\u2014serial number MSN009 and registration F-WWEA\u2014flew on 25 August 2006. On 4 September 2006, the first full passenger-carrying flight test took place. The aircraft flew from Toulouse with 474 Airbus employees on board, in a test of passenger facilities and comfort. In November 2006, a further series of route-proving flights demonstrated the aircraft's performance for 150 flight hours under typical airline operating conditions. As of 2014, the A380 test aircraft continue to perform test procedures. Airbus obtained type certificates for the A380-841 and A380-842 model from the EASA and FAA on 12 December 2006 in a joint ceremony at the company's French headquarters, receiving the ICAO code A388. The A380-861 model obtained its type certificate on 14 December 2007.\nInitial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530 km (330 mi) of wiring in each aircraft. Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of configuration management and change control. The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4, while British and French sites migrated to version 5. This caused overall configuration management problems, at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non-standard dimensions and bend radii; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software. Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months. This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90\u2013100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months. Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70\u201380 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus' parent, EADS, and led to the departure of EADS CEO No\u00ebl Forgeard, Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert, and A380 programme manager Charles Champion. On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 programme, Airbus CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay, pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010. The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to \u20ac4.8 billion. As Airbus prioritised the work on the A380-800 over the A380F, freighter orders were cancelled by FedEx and United Parcel Service, or converted to A380-800 by Emirates and ILFC. Airbus suspended work on the freighter version, but said it remained on offer, albeit without a service entry date. For the passenger version Airbus negotiated a revised delivery schedule and compensation with the 13 customers, all of which retained their orders with some placing subsequent orders, including Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Air France, Qatar Airways, and Korean Air. Beginning in 2007 the A380 was considered as a potential replacement for the existing Boeing VC-25 serving as Air Force One presidential transport, but in January 2009 EADS declared that they were not going to bid for the contract, as assembling only three planes in the US would not make financial sense. On 13 May 2008, Airbus announced reduced deliveries for the years 2008 (12) and 2009 (21). After further manufacturing setbacks, Airbus announced its plan to deliver 14 A380s in 2009, down from the previously revised target of 18. A total of 10 A380s were delivered in 2009. In 2010 Airbus delivered 18 of the expected 20 A380s, due to Rolls-Royce engine availability problems. Airbus planned to deliver \"between 20 and 25\" A380s in 2011 before ramping up to three a month in 2012. In fact, Airbus delivered 26 units, thus outdoing its predicted output for the first time. As of July 2012, production was 3 aircraft per month. Among the production problems are challenging interiors, interiors being installed sequentially rather than concurrently as in smaller planes, and union/government objections to streamlining.\nAt the July 2016 Farnborough Airshow Airbus announced that in a \u201cprudent, proactive step,\u201d starting in 2018 it expects to deliver 12 A380 aircraft per year, down from 27 deliveries in 2015. The firm also warned production might slip back into red ink on each aircraft produced at that time, though it anticipates production will remain in the black for 2016 and 2017. \u201cThe company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further.\u201d Airbus expects that healthy demand for its other aircraft would allow it to avoid job losses from the cuts. As Airbus expects to build 15 airliners in 2017 and 12 in 2018, Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Br\u00e9gier said without orders in 2017 production should be reduced below one per month while remaining profitable per unit and have the program continue for 20 to 30 years. Within its 2017 half-year report, Airbus adjusted 2019 deliveries to eight aircraft. In November 2017, its chief executive Tom Enders was confident Airbus will still produce A380s in 2027 with more sales to come, and to further develop it to keep it competitive beyond 2030. Airbus was profitable at a rate of 15 per year and is trying to drive breakeven down further but will make losses at eight per year. An Emirates order for 36 could be finalised to keep it produced beyond 2020, but the airline wants guarantees the production will be maintained for 10 years, till 2028: reducing output to six a year would help to bridge that period and would support second-hand values while other buyers are approached, but the programme would still be unprofitable. If it had failed to win the Emirates order, Airbus claimed that it was ready to phase out its production gradually as it went through its remaining orders until early 2020s. In January 2018, Emirates confirmed the order for 36 A380s, but the deal was thrown back into question in October 2018 over a disagreement regarding engine fuel burn. To extend the program, Airbus offered China a production role in early 2018. While state owned airlines could order A380s, it would not help their low yield as it lowers frequency, they do not need more volume as widebody aircraft are already used on domestic routes and using the A380 on its intended long haul missions would free only a few airport slots. After realising efficiencies to sustain production at a lower level, in 2017 Airbus delivered 15 \"very close\" to production breakeven while additional savings could continue as production is being further reduced: 12 should be delivered in 2018, eight in 2019 and six per year from 2020 with \"digestible\" losses. Enders is confident the A380 will gain additional orders from existing or new operators, and sees opportunities in Asia and particularly in China where it is \"under-represented\".\nNicknamed Superjumbo, the first A380, MSN003 (registered as 9V-SKA), was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October 2007 with flight number SQ380 between Singapore and Sydney. Passengers bought seats in a charity online auction paying between $560 and $100,380. Two months later, Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than either the airline or Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per seat-mile than the airline's 747\u2013400 fleet. Emirates' Tim Clark claimed that the A380 has better fuel economy at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83, and that its technical dispatch reliability is at 97%, the same as Singapore Airlines. Airbus is committed to reach the industry standard of 98.5%. Emirates was the second airline to receive the A380 and commenced service between Dubai and New York in August 2008. Qantas followed, with flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles in October 2008. By the end of 2008, 890,000 passengers had flown on 2,200 flights. In February 2009, the one millionth passenger was flown with Singapore Airlines and by May of that year 1,500,000 passengers had flown on 4,200 flights. Air France received its first A380 in October 2009. Lufthansa received its first A380 in May 2010. By July 2010, the 31 A380s then in service had transported 6 million passengers on 17,000 flights between 20 international destinations. Airbus delivered the 100th A380 on 14 March 2013 to Malaysia Airlines. In June 2014, over 65 million passengers had flown the A380, and more than 100 million passengers (averaging 375 per flight) by September 2015, with an availability of 98.5%. In 2014, Emirates stated that their A380 fleet had load factors of 90\u2013100%, and that the popularity of the aircraft with its passengers had not decreased in the past year.\nIn 2010, Airbus announced a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1.5\u00b0 increase in wing twist. Airbus will also offer, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by 4 t (8,800 lb), to 573 t (1,263,000 lb) and the range is extended by 100 nautical miles (190 km); this is achieved by reducing flight loads, partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws. British Airways and Emirates are the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013. Emirates has asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the 777X around 2020, and Airbus is studying 11-abreast seating. In 2012, Airbus announced another increase in the A380's maximum take-off weight to 575 t (1,268,000 lb), a 6 t increase from the initial A380 variant and 2 t higher than the increased-weight proposal of 2010. Its range will increase by some 150 nautical miles (280 km), taking its capability to around 8,350 nautical miles (15,460 km) at current payloads. The higher-weight version was offered for introduction to service early in 2013.\nDuring repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident, cracks were discovered in wing fittings. As a result, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 which affected 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1,300 flights. A380s with under 1,800 flight hours were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights; aircraft with over 1,800 flight hours were to be examined within four days or 14 flights. Fittings found to be cracked were replaced. On 8 February 2012, the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation. The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations. EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over $130 million, to be borne by Airbus. The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings. Additionally, major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets. Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this problem. Airbus is changing about 10% of all doors, as some leak during flight. One occurrence resulted in dropped oxygen masks and an emergency landing. The switch is expected to cost over \u20ac100 million. Airbus states that safety is sufficient, as the air pressure pushes the door into the frame.\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the A380-800 and the A380F. The A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration. Then in May 2007, Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers (525 total in three classes)\u2014traded for 200 nmi (370 km) more range\u2014to better reflect trends in premium-class accommodation. The design range for the 380\u2212800 model is 8,500 nmi (15,700 km); capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non-stop. The second model, the A380F freighter, would carry 150 tonnes of cargo with a range of 5,600 nmi (10,400 km). The freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version, and all cargo orders were cancelled. Future variants may include an A380-900 stretch\u2013seating about 656 passengers (or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration)\u2013and an extended-range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380-800.\nThe A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines. The Trent 900 is a combination of the 3 m (118 in) fan and scaled IP compressor of the 777-200X/300X Trent 8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777's Trent 800, and the Airbus A340-500/600's Trent 500 core. The GP7200 HP core technology is derived from GE's GE90 and its LP sections are based on the PW4000 expertise. At its launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level of technology and they would be state of the art for the next decade, but three years later Boeing launched the 787 with game-changing technology and 10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy. Thanks to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa's A380s produce half the noise of the Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers. In 2012, the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society. London Heathrow is a key destination for the A380. The aircraft is below the QC/2 departure and QC/0.5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by the airport. Field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the A380 may be overly generous compared to the older Boeing 747, but still quieter. Rolls-Royce is supporting the CAA in understanding the relatively high A380/Trent 900 monitored noise levels. Heathrow's landing charges having a noise component, the A380 is cheaper to land there than a Boeing 777-200 and -300 and it saves $4,300 to $5,200 per landing, or $15.3M to $18.8M of present value over 15 years. Tokyo Narita has a similar noise charge. Sufficient braking capacity allowed for thrust reversers to be installed on only the inboard engines. The outboard engines lack them, reducing the amount of debris stirred up during landing. They are electrically actuated to save weight and for better reliability than pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents.\nThe A380's wing is sized for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over 650 tonnes to accommodate these future versions, albeit with some internal strengthening required on the A380F freighter. The optimal wingspan for this weight is about 90 m (300 ft), but airport restrictions limited it to less than 80 m (260 ft), lowering aspect ratio to 7.8 which reduces fuel efficiency about 10% and increases operating costs a few percent, given that fuel costs constitute about 50% of the cost of long-haul airplane operation. The common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency on the A380-800 passenger model because of its weight but Airbus estimates that the aircraft's size and advanced technology will provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747-400. The wings incorporate wingtip fences that extend above and below the wing surface, similar to those on the A310 and A320. These increase fuel efficiency and range by reducing induced drag. The wingtip fences also reduce wake turbulence, which endangers following aircraft.\nWhile most of the fuselage is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380's airframe. Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, glass-fibre reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage), tail surfaces, and doors. The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic. It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics are used in the leading edges of the slats. The hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers' leading edges. This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation. Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques. The application of GLARE on the A380 has a long history, which shows the complex nature of innovations in the aircraft industry. Newer weldable aluminium alloys are used in the A380's airframe. This enables the widespread use of laser beam welding manufacturing techniques, eliminating rows of rivets and resulting in a lighter, stronger structure. High-strength aluminium (type 7449) reinforced with carbon fibre was used in the wing brackets of the first 120 A380s to reduce weight, but cracks have been discovered and new sets of the more critical brackets will be made of standard aluminium 7010, increasing weight by 90 kg (198 lb). Repair costs for earlier aircraft are expected to be around \u20ac500 million (US$629 million). It takes 3,600 L (950 US gal) of paint to cover the 3,100 m2 (33,000 sq ft) exterior of an A380. The paint is five layers thick and weighs about 650 kg (1,433 lb).\nThe A380 employs an integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture, first used in advanced military aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, and Dassault Rafale. The main IMA systems on the A380 were developed by the Thales Group. Designed and developed by Airbus, Thales and Diehl Aerospace, the IMA suite was first used on the A380. The suite is a technological innovation, with networked computing modules to support different applications. The data networks use Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet, an implementation of ARINC 664. These are switched, full-duplex, star-topology and based on 100baseTX fast-Ethernet. This reduces the amount of wiring required and minimises latency. Airbus used similar cockpit layout, procedures and handling characteristics to other Airbus aircraft, reducing crew training costs. The A380 has an improved glass cockpit, using fly-by-wire flight controls linked to side-sticks. The cockpit has eight 15 by 20 cm (5.9 by 7.9 in) liquid crystal displays, all physically identical and interchangeable; comprising two primary flight displays, two navigation displays, one engine parameter display, one system display and two multi-function displays. The MFDs were introduced on the A380 to provide an easy-to-use interface to the flight management system\u2014replacing three multifunction control and display units. They include QWERTY keyboards and trackballs, interfacing with a graphical \"point-and-click\" display system. The Network Systems Server (NSS) is the heart of A380's paperless cockpit; it eliminates bulky manuals and traditional charts. The NSS has enough inbuilt robustness to eliminate onboard backup paper documents. The A380's network and server system stores data and offers electronic documentation, providing a required equipment list, navigation charts, performance calculations, and an aircraft logbook. This is accessed through the MFDs and controlled via the keyboard interface.\nPower-by-wire flight control actuators have been used for the first time in civil aviation to back up primary hydraulic actuators. Also, during certain manoeuvres they augment the primary actuators. They have self-contained hydraulic and electrical power supplies. Electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) are used in the aileron and elevator, electric and hydraulic motors to drive the slats as well as electrical backup hydrostatic actuators (EBHA) for the rudder and some spoilers. The A380's 350 bar (35 MPa or 5,000 psi) hydraulic system is a significant difference from the typical 210 bar (21 MPa or 3,000 psi) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s. First used in military aircraft, high-pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines, actuators and related components. The 350 bar pressure is generated by eight de-clutchable hydraulic pumps. The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium; the system features both fuel- and air-cooled heat exchangers. Self-contained electrically powered hydraulic power packs serve as backups for the primary systems, instead of a secondary hydraulic system, saving weight and reducing maintenance. The A380 uses four 150 kVA variable-frequency electrical generators, eliminating constant-speed drives and improving reliability. The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction. The electrical power system is fully computerised and many contactors and breakers have been replaced by solid-state devices for better performance and increased reliability. The auxiliary power comprises the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), the electronic control box (ECB), and mounting hardware. The APU in use on the A380 is the PW 980A APU. The APU primarily provides air to power the Analysis Ground Station (AGS) on the ground and to start the engines. The AGS is a semi-automatic analysis system of flight data that helps to optimise management of maintenance and reduce costs. The APU also powers electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft.\nThe cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 1,520 m (5,000 ft) up to 12,000 m (39,000 ft). It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and 60 cm (2.0 ft) extra headroom versus the 747-400. Seating options range from 3-room 12 m2 (130 sq ft) \"residence\" in first class to 11-across in economy. A380 economy seats are up to 48 cm (19 in) wide in a 10-abreast configuration, compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats 44.5 cm (17.5 in) wide. On other aircraft, economy seats range from 41.5 to 52.3 cm (16.3 to 20.6 in) in width. The A380's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, fore and aft, wide enough to accommodate two passengers side-by-side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations. The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all-economy-class layout, Airbus lists the \"typical\" three-class layout as accommodating 525 passengers, with 10 first, 76 business, and 439 economy class seats. Airline configurations range from Korean Air's 407 passengers to Emirates' two-class 615 seats for Copenhagen, and average around 480\u2013490 seats. The Air Austral's proposed 840 passenger layout has not come to fruition. The A380's interior illumination system uses bulbless LEDs in the cabin, cockpit, and cargo decks. The LEDs in the cabin can be altered to create an ambience simulating daylight, night, or intermediate levels. On the outside of the aircraft, HID lighting is used for brighter illumination. Airbus's publicity has stressed the comfort and space of the A380 cabin, and advertised onboard relaxation areas such as bars, beauty salons, duty-free shops, and restaurants. Proposed amenities resembled those installed on earlier airliners, particularly 1970s wide-body jets, which largely gave way to regular seats for more passenger capacity. Airbus has acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed, and that it was ultimately the airlines' decision how to configure the interior. Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds, and raised costs. Due to delivery delays, Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380. Initial operators typically configured their A380s for three-class service, while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins. Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed first class suites on its A380s in 2007, each featuring a leather seat with a separate bed; center suites could be joined to create a double bed. A year later, Qantas debuted a new first class seat-bed and a sofa lounge at the front of the upper deck on its A380s, and in 2009 Air France unveiled an upper deck electronic art gallery. In late 2008, Emirates introduced \"shower spas\" in first class on its A380s allowing each first class passenger five minutes of hot water, drawing on 2.5 tonnes of water although only 60% of it was used. Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways also have a bar lounge and seating area on the upper deck, while Etihad has enclosed areas for two people each. In addition to lounge areas, some A380 operators have installed amenities consistent with other aircraft in their respective fleets, including self-serve snack bars, premium economy sections, and redesigned business class seating. The Hamburg Aircraft Interiors Expo in April 2015 saw the presentation of an 11-seat row economy cabin for the A380. Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travelers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the Airbus A330 and ten across on the A350.\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the \"80-metre box\" was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m (260 ft) wingspan and length to be accommodated. Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines, and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 metres (200 ft) loadbearing width. The US FAA initially opposed this, then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45 m (148 ft) runways without restrictions. The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400. Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders may be required to be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than 25 m (82 ft) from the centre line of the aircraft, compared to 21 m (69 ft) for the 747\u2013400, and 747\u20138. Airbus measured pavement loads using a 540-tonne (595 short tons) ballasted test rig, designed to replicate the landing gear of the A380. The rig was towed over a section of pavement at Airbus' facilities that had been instrumented with embedded load sensors. It was determined that the pavement of most runways will not need to be reinforced despite the higher weight, as it is distributed on more wheels than in other passenger aircraft with a total of 22 wheels (that is, its ground pressure is lower). The A380 undercarriage consists of four main landing gear legs and one noseleg (a similar layout to the 747), with the two inboard landing gear legs each supporting six wheels. The A380 requires service vehicles with lifts capable of reaching the upper deck, as well as tractors capable of handling the A380's maximum ramp weight. When using two jetway bridges the boarding time is 45 min, and when using an extra jetway to the upper deck it is reduced to 34 min. The A380 has an airport turnaround time of 90\u2013110 minutes. In 2008 the A380 test aircraft were used to trial the modifications made to several airports to accommodate the type.\nIn 2005, the ICAO recommended that provisional separation criteria for the A380 on takeoff and landing be substantially greater than for the 747 because preliminary flight test data suggested a stronger wake turbulence. These criteria were in effect while the ICAO's wake vortex steering group, with representatives from the JAA, Eurocontrol, the FAA, and Airbus, refined its 3-year study of the issue with additional flight testing. In September 2006, the working group presented its first conclusions to the ICAO. In November 2006, the ICAO issued new interim recommendations. Replacing a blanket 10 nautical miles (19 km) separation for aircraft trailing an A380 during approach, the new distances were 6 nmi (11 km), 8 nmi (15 km) and 10 nmi (19 km) respectively for non-A380 \"Heavy\", \"Medium\", and \"Light\" ICAO aircraft categories. These compared with the 4 nmi (7.4 km), 5 nmi (9.3 km) and 6 nmi (11 km) spacing applicable to other \"Heavy\" aircraft. Another A380 following an A380 should maintain a separation of 4 nmi (7.4 km). On departure behind an A380, non-A380 \"Heavy\" aircraft are required to wait two minutes, and \"Medium\"/\"Light\" aircraft three minutes for time based operations. The ICAO also recommends that pilots append the term \"Super\" to the aircraft's callsign when initiating communication with air traffic control, to distinguish the A380 from \"Heavy\" aircraft. In August 2008, the ICAO issued revised approach separations of 4 nmi (7.4 km) for Super (another A380), 6 nmi (11 km) for Heavy, 7 nmi (13 km) for medium/small, and 8 nmi (15 km) for light. In November 2008, an incident on a parallel runway during crosswinds made the Australian authorities change procedures for those conditions. Singapore Airlines describe the A380's landing speed of 130\u2013135 kn (240\u2013250 km/h) as \"impressively slow\".\nAs the A380 fleet grows older, airworthiness authority rules require certain scheduled inspections from approved aircraft tool shops. The increasing fleet size (to about 286 in 2020) cause expected maintenance and modification to cost $6.8 billion for 2015\u20132020, of which $2.1 billion are for engines. Emirates performed its first 3C-check for 55 days in 2014. During lengthy shop stays, some airlines will use the opportunity to install new interiors.\nVariants:\nA380F:\nAirbus originally accepted orders for the freighter variant, offering the largest payload capacity of any cargo aircraft in production, exceeded only by the single Antonov An-225 Mriya in service. An aerospace consultant has estimated that the A380F would have 7% better payload and better range than the Boeing 747-8F, but also higher trip costs. However, production was suspended until the A380 production lines have settled, with no firm availability date. In 2015, Airbus removed A380F from the range of freighters on its corporate website. The maximum payload would have been 150 t (330,000 lb), with a 5,600 nmi (10,400 km) range. A patent for \"combi\" version was applied for. This version would offer the flexibility of carrying both passengers and cargo, along with being rapidly reconfigurable to expand or contract the cargo area and passenger area as needed for a given flight.\nA380-900:\nIn November 2007, Airbus top sales executive and chief operating officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant\u2014the A380-900\u2014with more seating space than the A380-800. The A380-900 would have a seating capacity for 650 passengers in standard configuration and for approximately 900 passengers in an economy-only configuration. Airlines that expressed an interest in the 380-900 included Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Kingfisher Airlines, and leasing company ILFC. In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development would be postponed until production of the A380-800 stabilised. On 11 December 2014, at the annual Airbus Investor Day forum, Airbus CEO controversially announced, \"We will one day launch an A380neo and one day launch a stretched A380\". This statement followed speculation sparked by Airbus CFO Harald Wilhelm that Airbus could possibly axe the A380 ahead of its time due to softening demand. On 15 June 2015, John Leahy, Airbus's chief operating officer for customers, stated that Airbus was again looking at the A380-900 programme. Airbus's newest concept would be a stretch of the A380-800 offering 50 seats more\u2014not 100 seats as originally envisaged. This stretch would be tied to a potential re-engining of the A380-800. According to Flight Global, an A380-900 would make better use of the A380's existing wing.\nA380neo:\nOn 15 June 2015, Reuters reported that Airbus was discussing a stretched version of the A380 with a half dozen customers. This aircraft, which could also feature new engines, would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021. On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Br\u00e9gier stated that the company will build a new version of the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines. Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (\"neo\" for \"new engine option\") had been going on for a few months after earlier press releases in 2014, and in 2015 the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018 or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900 and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. Br\u00e9gier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020. The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all-new options from Rolls-Royce, ranging from derivatives of the A350's XWB-84/97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020. On 3 June 2016, Emirates President Tim Clark stated that talks between Emirates and Airbus on the A380neo have \"lapsed\". On 12 June 2017, Fabrice Br\u00e9gier confirmed that Airbus will not launch an A380neo, stating \"...there is no business case to do that, this is absolutely clear.\" However, Br\u00e9gier stated it won't stop Airbus from looking at what could be done to improve the performance of the aircraft. One such proposal is a 32 ft (9.8 m) wingspan extension to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency by 4%, though further increase is likely to be seen on the aircraft with new Sharklets like on the A380 Plus.\nA380plus:\nLaunched at the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus offers an A380plus enhanced version with 13% lower costs per seat, featuring up to 80 more seats through better use of cabin space, split scimitar winglets and wing refinements allowing a 4% fuel economy improvement, and longer aircraft maintenance intervals with less downtime. Its maximum takeoff weight is increased by 3 t (6,600 lb) to 578 t (1,274,000 lb), allowing it to carry more passengers over the same 8,200 nmi range or increase the range by 300 nm. Emirates could order 20 aircraft at the November Dubai Air Show. The upgrade will be available from 2020. Winglet mockups, 4.7m (15 ft) high, were displayed on the MSN04 test aircraft at Le Bourget. Wing twist will be modified and camber changed by increasing its height by 33 mm (1.3 in) between Rib 10 and Rib 30, along with upper-belly fairing improvements. The in-flight entertainment, the flight management system and the fuel pumps will come from the A350 to reduce weight and improve reliability and fuel economy. Light checks will be required after 1,000 hr instead of 750 hr and heavy check downtime will be reduced to keep the aircraft flying for six days more per year.\nIn its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus estimated the demand for 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019. The market is estimated for two decades at more than 1,700 by Airbus and 700 by Boeing since 1999-2000, including freighters. In 2006, industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol anticipated 880 sales by 2025 with Airbus having conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of commercial aviation ever undertaken, justifying its VLA plans to design the A380 by the spoke-hub distribution paradigm while Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia anticipated 400 with the rise of mid-size aircraft and market fragmentation reducing them to niche markets, making such plans unjustified in a point-to-point transit model. In 2007, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,283 VLA in the following 20 years if airport congestion remains constant, up to 1,771 VLAs if congestion increases, with most deliveries (56%) in Asia-Pacific, and 415 very large, 120-tonne plus freighters. For the same period, Boeing was estimating the demand for 590 large (B747 or A380) passenger airliners and 630 freighters. On 15 May 2018, in its EU appeal ruling, the WTO concluded that the A380 received improper subsidies through $9 billion of launch aids, but Airbus acknowledges that the threat posed to Boeing by the A380 is so marginal with 330 orders since its 2000 launch that any U.S. sanctions should be minimal, as previous rulings showed Boeing's exposure could be as little as $377 million.\nIn 2013, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines needed to balance frequency and capacity. China Southern struggled for two years to use its A380s from Beijing, and finally received Boeing 787s in its base in Guangzhou, but where it cannot command a premium, unlike Beijing or Shanghai. In 2013, Air France withdrew A380 services to Singapore and Montreal and switched to smaller aircraft. In 2014, British Airways replaced three 777 flights between London and Los Angeles with two A380 per day. Emirates' Tim Clark saw a large potential for Asian A380-users, and criticised Airbus' marketing efforts. As business travellers prefer more choices offered by more frequencies, flying a route multiple times on smaller aircraft rather than once on a large plane, United Airlines observed the A380 \"just doesn't really work for us\" as it relies on Boeing 787s operating at a lower trip cost. At the A380 launch, most Europe-Asia and transpacific routes used 747-400s at fairly low frequencies, but since then, routes proliferated with open skies and most airlines downsized to offer higher frequencies and more routes. The huge capacity offered by each flight eroded the yield: North America was viewed as 17% of the market but it never materialised as a 747 replacement with only fifteen 747s remaining in passenger service in November 2017, for transpacific routes where timezones restrict potential frequency, consolidation changed the networks and US majors constrained capacity and emphasised daily frequencies for business traffic with midsize widebodies like the 787 to extract higher yields, focusing on profits rather than market share leaved to Asian carriers. The 747 was removed from the transatlantic flights by the 767 and from the transpacific market by the 777: newer, smaller aircraft with similar seat-mile costs have lower trip costs and allow more direct routes. Cabin densification to lower unit costs could aggravate this overcapacity.\nIn 2005, 270 sales were necessary to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its Internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006. In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected. In 2012, Airbus clarified that the aircraft production costs would be less than its sales price. On 11 December 2014, Airbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm hinted the possibility of ending the programme in 2018, disappointing Emirates president Tim Clark. Airbus shares fell down consequently. Airbus responded to the protests by playing down the possibility the A380 would be abandoned, instead emphasising that enhancing the airplane was a likelier scenario. On 22 December 2014, as the jet was about to break even, Airbus CEO Fabrice Br\u00e9gier ruled out cancelling it. Ten years after its first flight, Br\u00e9gier said it was \"almost certainly introduced ten years too early\". While no longer losing money on each plane sold, Airbus admits that the company will never recoup the $25 billion investment it made in the project. Airbus consistently forecast 1,400 VLA demand over 20-year, still in 2017, and aimed to secure a 50% share, up to 700 units, but delivered 215 aircraft in 10 years, achieving three produced per month but not the four per month target after the ramp-up to achieve more than 350 and is now declining to 0.5 a month. As Boeing see the VLA market as too small to retain in its 2017 forecast, its VP marketing Randy Tinseth doesn't believe Airbus will deliver the rest of the backlog. Richard Aboulafia predicts a 2020 final delivery, with unpleasant losses due to \"hubris, shoddy market analysis, nationalism and simple wishful thinking\". In 2017, the A380 fleet overtook the passengers B747s, declining from 740 aircraft when the A380 was launched in 2000 to 550 units at the A380 introduction in 2007, and around 200 ten years after while the combined fleet of A380s and 747s passenger jumbos is 430, the market-share battle having shifted to large single-aisles and 300-seat twin-aisles.\nAs of 2016 the list price of an A380 is US$432.6 million. Negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower, and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself. The first aircraft was sold and leased back by Singapore Airlines in 2007 to Dr. Peters for $197 million. In 2016, IAG's Willie Walsh said he could add a few, but also that he found the price of new aircraft \"outrageous\" and would source them from the second-hand market. AirInsight estimates its hourly cost at $26,000, or around $50 per seat hour (for 520 seats), which compares to $44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777-300ER, and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 as of November 2015. As it has very large wing and tail surfaces to allow a stretch and a high empty weight per seat, its cost-per-seat advantage eroded, and the A350-1000 and 777-9 will match it.\nAs of mid-2015, several airlines have expressed their interest in selling their aircraft, partially coinciding with expiring lease contracts for the aircraft. Several A380s which are in service have been offered for lease to other airlines. The suggestion has prompted concerns on the potential for new sales for Airbus, although these were dismissed by Airbus COO John Leahy who stated that \"Used A380s do not compete with new A380s\", stating that the second-hand market is more interesting for parties otherwise looking to buy smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 777. After Malaysia Airlines (MAS) was unable to sell or lease its six A380s, it decided to refurbish the aircraft with seating for 700 and transfer them to a subsidiary carrier for religious pilgrimage flights. As it started receiving its six A350s to replace its A380s in December 2017, the new subsidiary will serve the Hajj and Umrah market with them, starting in the third quarter of 2018 and could be expanded above six beyond 2020 to 2022. The cabin will have 36 business seats and 600 economy seats, with a 712-seat reconfiguration possible within five days. The fleet could be chartered half the year for the tourism industry like cruise shipping and will be able to operate for the next 40 years if oil prices stay low. As they should be parked by June 2018 before reconfiguration, MAS confirmed the plans and will also use them for peak periods to high traffic markets like London. In August 2017, it was announced that Hi Fly would lease two used aircraft. The Portuguese ACMI/charter airline will use the aircraft for markets where high capacity is needed and airports where slots are scarce. The first aircraft was scheduled to begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2018 Hi Fly was to receive its A380s from mid-2018 in a 471-seat configuration: 399 on the main deck, 60 business-class and 12 first-class seats on the upper deck, the Singapore Airlines layout. Hi Fly first used one of their A380s on 1 August 2018 for a one-off flight to enable Thomas Cook Airlines to repatriate passengers from Rhodes to Copenhagen following IT problems in the Greek airport. The same aircraft was then wet-leased to Norwegian to operate its evening London-New York service for several weeks in August 2018, to alleviate availability issues on its Boeing 787s affected by Trent 1000 engine problems; Air Austral also signed a deal to wet-lease an A380 from Hi Fly while one of its 787s is grounded for three months of Trent 1000 inspections. Amedeo, mainly an A380 lessor and the largest with 22, mostly leased to Emirates, wants to find a use for them after their lease expires from 2022, and study if there is a demand to wet lease them. Swiss aircraft broker Sparfell & Partners plans to convert for head-of-state or VVIP transport some of Dr. Peters' four ex-SIA A380s for under $300 million apiece, less than a new Boeing 777 or Airbus A330.\nWith four A380s leased to Singapore Airlines having been returned between October 2017 and March 2018, Dr. Peters fears a weak aftermarket and is considering scrapping them, although they are on sale for a business jet conversion, but on the other hand Airbus sees a potential for African airlines and Chinese airlines, Hajj charters and its large Gulf operators. An A380 parted out may be worth $30 million to $50 million if it is at half-life. Teardown specialists have declined offers for several aircraft at part-out prices due to high risk as a secondary market is uncertain with $30 to $40 million for the refurbishment, but should be between $20 to $30 million to be viable. After proposing the aircraft to BA, Hi Fly and Iran Air, Dr. Peters was to recommend to its investors on 28 June 2018 to sell the aircraft parts with VAS Aero Services within two years for 45 million USD, quickly for components like the landing gear or the APU. Rolls-Royce Trent 900 leasing beyond March 2019 should generate 480,000 USD monthly for each aircraft before selling the turbofans by 2020. With a total revenue of 80 million USD per aircraft, the overall return expected is 145-155% while 72% and 81% of their debt had already be repaid. BA wanted to replace its Boeing 747s but from 2021, Iran Air faced political uncertainty and Hi Fly did not have a convincing business case. The fifth plane coming back from SIA, owned by Amedeo (formerly Doric), may still go to Hi Fly. Two others should return from Singapore Air in coming weeks but they could stay with an existing Asian A380 flag carrier. VAS Aero Services is a US aftermarket firm. The teardown value includes $32-$33 million from the engines in 2020 and $4 million from leasing them until then, while the value of a 2008 A380 would be $78.4 million in 2020 and its monthly lease in 2018 would be $929,000. The two aircraft have returned 3.8-4.2% per year since 2008 but the 145-155% return is lower than the 220% originally forecast. Of the nearly 500 made, 50 747-400s were sold in the secondary market, including only 25 to new customers. These are among the first A380s delivered, lacking the improvements and weight savings of later ones.\nEighteen customers have ordered the A380. Total orders for the A380 stand at 331 as of May 2018. The biggest customer is Emirates, which has ordered or committed to order a total of 162 A380s. One VIP order was made in 2007 but later cancelled by Airbus. The A380F version attracted 27 orders, before they were either cancelled (20) or converted to A380-800 (7) following the production delay and the subsequent suspension of the freighter program. Delivery takes place in Hamburg for customers from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers from the rest of the world. EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the wing rib brackets where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet. In 2013, in expectation of raising the number of orders placed, Airbus announced 'attractable discounts' to airlines who placed large orders for the A380.[not in citation given] Soon after, at the November 2013 Dubai Air Show where it ordered 150 B777X, Emirates ordered 50 aircraft, totalling $20 billion. In 2014, Airbus said that some ordered A380s might not be built for an undisclosed Japanese airline. Qantas planned to order eight more airplanes but is in doubt due to a cost-cutting drive. Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, had not found a client for the airliner as of 2014. Virgin Atlantic ordered six A380s in 2001 but never took delivery and later cancelled them in 2018. As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders outstanding but due to lack of space in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord. At its 100th delivery ceremony, Emirates Airline head Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum was hoping to order new A380s at the November 2017 Dubai Air Show the following week. Emirates does not need the small front staircase and eleven-abreast economy of the A380plus concept, but wants Airbus to commit to continue production for at least 10 years. On 18 January 2018, Airbus secured a preliminary agreement from Emirates for up to 36 A380s: 20 potentially firm orders and 16 options, to be delivered from 2020, valued at $16 billion at list prices. John Leahy is confident that Airbus will secure one more A380 order in 2018; discussions are reportedly under way with IAG for British Airways to take new A380s, which could be cheaper than refurbishing second-hand planes to its specifications.\n\n\nCockpit crew in A380-800 - Two.\nSeating in A380-800 - 575 Typical, 853 Max555: 22F + 96J + 437Y.\nExit limit in A380-800 - 868: 538 lower + 330 upper deck.\nCargo in A380-800 - 175.2 m3 (6,190 cu ft).\nLength in A380-800 - 72.72 m (238 ft 7 in).\nWingspan in A380-800 - 79.75 m (261 ft 8 in).\nHeight in A380-800 - 24.09 m (79 ft 0 in).\nFuselage in A380-800 - Width: 7.14 m (23 ft 5 in)Height: 8.41 m (27 ft 7 in).\nCabin width in A380-800 - 6.50 m (21 ft 4 in) main deck5.80 m (19 ft 0 in) upper deck.\nCabin length in A380-800 - 49.9 m (163 ft 9 in) main deck44.93 m (147 ft 5 in) upper deck.\nWing in A380-800 - 845 m2 (9,100 sq ft), AR 7.53, sweep 33.5\u00b0.\nMTOW in A380-800 - 575 t (1,268,000 lb).\nOEW in A380-800 - 277 t (611,000 lb).\nMax. payload in A380-800 - 84 t (185,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A380-800 - 253 983 kg / 559 937 lb.\nEngines (4 \u00d7) in A380-800 - GP7200 / Trent 900.\nThrust (4 \u00d7) in A380-800 - 332.44\u2013356.81 kN (74,740\u201380,210 lbf).\nMMo in A380-800 - Mach 0.89 (945 km/h; 511 kn).\nCruise speed in A380-800 - Mach 0.85 (903 km/h; 488 kn).\nLanding speed in A380-800 - 138 kn (256 km/h).\nTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A380-800 - 3,000 m (9,800 ft).\nRange in A380-800 - 14,800 km / 8,000 nmi.\nService ceiling in A380-800 - 13,100 m (43,000 ft).\nOverall length of A380 is 72.72 m.\nCabin length of A380 is 49.90 m.\nFuselage max diametr of A380 is 7.14 m.\nMax cabin width of A380 is 6.54 m.\nWingspan of A380 is 79.75 m.\nHeight of A380 is 24.09 m.\nTrack if A380 is 14.34 m.\nWheelbase of A380 is 31.88 m.\nTypical seating pax of A380 is 575.\nMax seating pax of A380 is 853.\nLD3 capacity number underfloor in freight type of A380 is 13.\nBulk hold volume in freight type of A380 is 14.30 m^3 .\nTotal volume in freight type of A380 is 184.20 m^3.\nRange of A380 is 14800 km.\nMmo if A380 is M0.89.\nMax ramp weight of A380 is 577 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A380 is 575 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A380 is 394 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A380 is 369 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A380 is 320000 litres.\nCockpit crew in A380 - Two.\nSeating in A380 - 575 Typical, 853 Max555: 22F + 96J + 437Y.\nExit limit in A380 - 868: 538 lower + 330 upper deck.\nCargo in A380 - 175.2 m3 (6,190 cu ft).\nLength in A380 - 72.72 m (238 ft 7 in).\nWingspan in A380 - 79.75 m (261 ft 8 in).\nHeight in A380 - 24.09 m (79 ft 0 in).\nFuselage in A380 - Width: 7.14 m (23 ft 5 in)Height: 8.41 m (27 ft 7 in).\nCabin width in A380 - 6.50 m (21 ft 4 in) main deck5.80 m (19 ft 0 in) upper deck.\nCabin length in A380 - 49.9 m (163 ft 9 in) main deck44.93 m (147 ft 5 in) upper deck.\nWing in A380 - 845 m2 (9,100 sq ft), AR 7.53, sweep 33.5\u00b0.\nMTOW in A380 - 575 t (1,268,000 lb).\nOEW in A380 - 277 t (611,000 lb).\nMax. payload in A380 - 84 t (185,000 lb).\nFuel capacity in A380 - 253 983 kg / 559 937 lb.\nEngines (4 \u00d7) in A380 - GP7200 / Trent 900.\nThrust (4 \u00d7) in A380 - 332.44\u2013356.81 kN (74,740\u201380,210 lbf).\nMMo in A380 - Mach 0.89 (945 km/h; 511 kn).\nCruise speed in A380 - Mach 0.85 (903 km/h; 488 kn).\nLanding speed in A380 - 138 kn (256 km/h).\nTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A380 - 3,000 m (9,800 ft).\nRange in A380 - 14,800 km / 8,000 nmi.\nService ceiling in A380 - 13,100 m (43,000 ft).\nOverall length of A380 is 72.72 m.\nCabin length of A380 is 49.90 m.\nFuselage max diametr of A380 is 7.14 m.\nMax cabin width of A380 is 6.54 m.\nWingspan of A380 is 79.75 m.\nHeight of A380 is 24.09 m.\nTrack if A380 is 14.34 m.\nWheelbase of A380 is 31.88 m.\nTypical seating pax of A380 is 575.\nMax seating pax of A380 is 853.\nLD3 capacity number underfloor in freight type of A380 is 13.\nBulk hold volume in freight type of A380 is 14.30 m^3 .\nTotal volume in freight type of A380 is 184.20 m^3.\nRange of A380 is 14800 km.\nMmo if A380 is M0.89.\nMax ramp weight of A380 is 577 tonnes.\nMax take-off weight of A380 is 575 tonnes.\nMax landing weight of A380 is 394 tonnes.\nMax zero fuel weight of A380 is 369 tonnes.\nMax fuel capacity of A380 is 320000 litres."}, {"title": "Airbus_in_Africa_and_the_Middle_East.txt", "text": "Airbus in Africa and the Middle East:\n\tFor more than four decades, Airbus commercial airliners, helicopters, military aircraft and satellites have flown the skies of Africa and the Middle East. From Dubai to Cape Town, Airbus\u2019 activity reflects the company\u2019s slogan: \u201cWe make it fly.\u201d Airbus has a significant presence throughout the region, employing more than 3,100 people across Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. Airbus regional headquarters is in Dubai, also home to Emirates airlines, the largest customer of the flagship A380 jetliner. Airbus\u2019 products and services are widely recognised as being well-suited to Africa and the Middle East, yet the company\u2019s commitment to the region goes beyond selling: Airbus pursues humanitarian objectives and also provides training and support by building local entities, creating jobs and ultimately contributing to the economic development of the region. In addition, Airbus identifies knowledge, skills, talent and capacities that can be developed to address global talent shortages. Airbus sources supplies and components from multiple companies within four African and Middle Eastern countries, and is proud to be a part of a region united in its embrace of innovation to build future prosperity for the generations ahead.\n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tAirbus sold its first aircraft in the Middle East in 1970; as of early 2018, more than 700 Airbus aircraft operate here, and Airbus has signed orders for more than 1,300 aircraft bound for Middle Eastern carriers over the next decade that span the spectrum of the company\u2019s products. Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways all operate the flagship A380 jetliner, and Qatar Airways was the launch operator for the both the A350-1000 and A350-900 variants. Airbus has been making significant inroads into the African aviation market with 28 new Airbus operators since 2010. As of early 2018, around 32 African airlines operate nearly 240 Airbus aircraft, and customers in the region account for more than 260 additional aircraft on the order books. Airbus achieved an 83 percent market share in terms of new aircraft sales in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2016.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tMore than 650 Airbus helicopters are flown by both civil and military operators across Africa and the Middle East in applications as varied as anti-piracy, counter-insurgency, border patrol, emergency medical airlift, search and rescue missions, VIP transport and the servicing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Airbus is further increasing its Middle Eastern footprint with a customer-oriented strategy based on teaming with local partners for helicopter fleet modernisation, overhauling and maintenance. This includes a new technical office in Pakistan, working with the Falcon Aviation Services maintenance centre in the United Arab Emirates and cooperating with AMMROC for helicopter overhauls. Airbus is developing a regional industrial base relying on Eurocopter Kingdom Saudi Arabia, its largest subsidiary located in Saudi Arabia with more than 120 engineers and technicians dedicated to the maintenance, overhaul and modernisation. In Africa, Airbus is broadening and deepening its presence through its regional subsidiary, Airbus Helicopters Southern Africa, which offers aircraft assembly, completions, maintenance, engineering and training. It supports around 150 turbine-powered helicopters operated by customers in 20 countries across the sub-Saharan/Indian Ocean region.\n\tDefence:\n\t\tAirbus is part of the Eurofighter consortium, manufacturer of the world's most advanced combat aircraft \u2013 the Eurofighter Typhoon. As of early 2018, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is acquiring 72 Typhoons; the Sultanate of Oman has ordered 12. As of early 2018, the UAE Air Force and the Royal Saudi Air Force operate three and four Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transports (MRTT), respectively. All told, the defence arm of Airbus has won more than 70 orders for light and medium transport aircraft in the Middle East. As of early 2018, Airbus aircraft are in service in 12 African nations, with Airbus securing 90 orders for light and medium transport aircraft (C212, CN235 and C295) from 18 customers, of which 86 aircraft have been delivered. Egypt is the largest single customer worldwide for the C295 , emphasising the aircraft's suitability for the region due to its exceptional reliability in hot and dusty conditions. In addition, Airbus A400M military transporters in service with the French and German air forces are regularly deployed on peace support and related missions in Africa.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tAirbus offers a wide portfolio of Earth observation satellite capabilities and services to governments and institutions, including the South African National Space Agency, and has built numerous telecom satellites that provide African coverage and enable crucial communications services across the region. These include Egypt\u2019s Nilesat and Algeria\u2019s ALSAT 2A, which has spent more than five years in orbit. For the Kingdom of Morocco, Airbus has the satellite prime contractor role for the MOHAMMED VI-A Earth observation satellite, in charge of its integration, as well as supplying the platform and the ground segment for mission planning and satellite control. This spacecraft is designed for mapping and land surveying activities, regional development, agricultural monitoring, the prevention and management of natural disasters, monitoring changes in the environment and desertification, as well as border and coastal surveillance. Airbus holds a contract with the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates for the development, manufacturing and launch of Falcon Eye, a high-performance optical Earth-observation satellite system. The contract includes the manufacture of two satellites with high-resolution optical capabilities and a ground system for monitoring, receiving and processing images, as well as a training programme for the engineers from the UAE who will control and operate the satellite once in orbit.\n\tLocal partners: \n\t\tIn the United Arab Emirates, Strata produces composite components for the A330, A330neo, A350 XWB and A380 jetliners while TPI produces metallic parts for the A320, A320neo and A330 programmes. In both Morocco and Tunisia, Airbus suppliers and Airbus subsidiary STELIA Aerospace utilise a highly skilled workforce while taking advantage of the proximity to Europe to source a mix of machined composite, electrical and assembled components across all Airbus programmes. South Africa\u2019s aerospace industry is a major supplier of parts, components and sub-assemblies that are incorporated across the Airbus product range. \n\tCorporate Citizenship:\n\t\tThe Airbus Foundation works throughout the Africa and the Middle East to advance humanitarian outreach. In coordination with Action Contre la Faim, Emirates airlines regularly utilises deliveries of its Airbus A380 jetliners to transport food and aid to the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai. Ethiopian Airlines transported some 11 tonnes of humanitarian goods destined to provide relief to drought-prone areas in eastern Africa aboard one of its A350 XWBs. In 2017, the Airbus Foundation used an Airbus A330 test aircraft to transport 100 cubic metres, \u2013 some 17 tonnes \u2013  of relief equipment and specialised water and sanitation equipment to Entebbe, Uganda to assist the increasing number of refugees escaping the deteriorating conflict situation in South Sudan. In Airbus\u2019 partnership with South African Airways, educational material and sports equipment have been distributed to children in some of South Africa\u2019s most disadvantaged communities. Rwandair utilised the delivery flight of its second A330 to transport 1.2 tonnes of humanitarian goods, medical supplies, and medical equipment. And in 2017, the Airbus Foundation used an Airbus A330 test aircraft to transport 17 tonnes of relief equipment and specialised water and sanitation equipment to Entebbe, Uganda to assist with the increasing number of refugees escaping the deteriorating conflict situation in South Sudan.\n\tThe future of Africa and the Middle East:\n\t\tCommercial air traffic in Africa and the Middle East is expected to see the biggest growth worldwide in the coming decades, with 5.5 percent annual growth expected in Africa and 6.2 percent annual growth in the Middle East, according to Airbus\u2019 Global Market Forecast. With the increase in air traffic comes a corresponding demand for additional aircraft. In Africa, the Airbus Global Market Forecast translates this into an anticipated need for 1,130 new passenger and freighter aircraft by 2037; the Middle East will require an additional 2,365 new aircraft to meet the forecasted demand.\n"}, {"title": "Airbus_in_Canada.txt", "text": "Airbus in Canada:\n\tFrom its first helicopter manufacturing facility in 1984 to the production of A220 Family single-aisle jetliners today, Airbus has significantly increased its presence in Canada. With nine locations in seven Canadian cities, Airbus has robust industrial activity in the country, covering the commercial jet aircraft, rotorcraft, defence and space sectors. The company\u2019s ties to Canada were strengthened in October 2017 with an Airbus-Bombardier partnership that saw the marketing, manufacturing and support of A220 Family aircraft transferred to Airbus\u2019 stewardship as Bombardier\u2019s two C Series jetliners were brought into the Airbus line-up. Other Airbus companies in Canada include NavBlue, based in Waterloo, Ontario and STELIA Aerospace Group, a multi-specialist aeronautics company with two subsidiaries in Canada. NavBlue is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of navigation charts and data in the aviation market. STELIA North America, based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and Mirabel, Quebec, provides design services, assembly, systems integration, and manufacturing of complex composites and metallic structures, sub-assemblies and components. \n\tCommercial aircraft:\n\t\tAirbus' ties to Canada were deepened in October 2017 when Airbus sought to acquire a majority stake in the C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP), the entity that manufactures and sells Bombardier\u2019s single-aisle C Series jets \u2013 renamed the A220 Family, with its two versions designated the A220-100 and A220-300. The partnership markets, manufactures and supports the A220 Family worldwide. Airbus believes that combining its global reach and scale with Bombardier\u2019s state-of-the-art aircraft and committed CSALP team will unlock the potential of the A220 Family, creating significant new value for customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders. A220 Family jetliners destined for all local and non-U.S. customers worldwide will be produced at the Mirabel final assembly line in Quebec, while A220 Family aircraft meant for U.S. markets will be produced at Airbus\u2019 facility in Mobile, Alabama (currently home to an A320 final assembly line). Airbus jetliners have long been a popular choice of Canadian airlines: Air Canada, as of mid-2018, operates a fleet that includes widebody A330-300s, along with the single-aisle A321-200, A320-200, and A319-100. Air Transat\u2019s widebody fleet comprises A310-300, A330-200, and A330-300 aircraft.\n\tHelicopters:\t\n\t\tHeadquartered in Fort Erie, Ontario, Airbus\u2019 helicopter division has additional facilities in British Columbia and Quebec, supporting more than 200 operators flying 700-plus aircraft. The company markets and manufactures the rotorcraft, and provides services that include repair and overhaul, flight testing and training solutions.

The government of Canada has a National Master Standing Offer with Airbus that facilitates the purchase of its commercial satellite imagery products and data. Earth-observation data from Airbus is collected using a constellation of company-built state-of-the-art optical and radar satellites. Many Canadian satellites incorporate equipment and systems delivered by Airbus and its subsidiary companies. For example, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited \u2013 the world's leading small satellite company \u2013 provided the agile bus platform used by the Canadian Department of National Defence\u2019s highly successful Sapphire satellite. Airbus also provided equipment, such as the crypto module, GPS receiver, and star trackers, that are used by the Canadian Space Agency\u2019s RCM radar satellites. The Space Systems and Communications, Intelligence and Security divisions of Airbus have successfully addressed many Canadian space requirements in the past. Today, they are well positioned to participate in several significant Canadian space projects (planned as of mid-2018), including SAR Data Continuity, DESSP, ESCP-P, Surveillance of Space 2, and the Terrestrial Snow Mass Mission. Airbus is developing mission concepts and solutions for these and other Canadian space requirements. The CP-140 Aurora long-range maritime patrol aircraft operated by the RCAF will receive equipment upgrades that include the addition of Airbus\u2019 AirPatrol satellite communication terminals to provide high data-rate communications capability that will enhance their intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission performance.\n\tLocal partners: \n\t\tWorking with more than 650 Canadian suppliers across nine provinces in the country, Airbus sources more than $1 billion (Canadian dollars) annually from Canadian companies as of mid-2018 \u2013 spending that supports approximately 17,000 skilled jobs. Canada is ranked ninth globally in terms of Airbus\u2019 supply chain procurement.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus is a frontrunner for innovation and skills in Canada with 48 research and technology projects ongoing or completed in association with the government of Canada\u2019s National Research Council and Canadian universities as of mid-2018. \n\tCorporate citizenship:\n\t\tOne of the ways in which Airbus gives back to the community is by inspiring and encouraging youth development through contact with the aerospace industry. In Canada, to support this mission, Airbus has sponsored an awareness campaign in Montreal, Quebec called \u201cRise to the Future,\u201d developed by A\u00e9ro Montreal, Quebec's aerospace cluster in conjunction with l'\u00c9cole Nationale d'A\u00e9rotechnique in St-Hubert, Quebec, the \u00c9cole des m\u00e9tiers de l'a\u00e9rospatiale de Montr\u00e9al, and the Comit\u00e9 sectoriel de main-d'\u0153uvre en a\u00e9rospatiale. The campaign aims to promote training for Quebecers for careers in booming aerospace sector. Airbus has also supported numerous efforts to improve the lives of Canadians, such as participating in the Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada\u2019s Big Bike charity event in Fort Erie, Ontario to raise funding for critical research to help prevent and treat heart disease and stroke.\n\tCanada's future:\n\t\tWith more than 35 years in Canada and employees coast-to-coast; as well as with the A220 Family partnership, Airbus\u2019 presence in Canada will continue to grow. Canada will become one of five Airbus home countries in the world \u2013 eventually being on par with the U.K., France, Germany and Spain \u2013 meaning there is anticipated growth and opportunity in the aerospace industry for Canada."}, {"title": "Airbus_in_China.txt", "text": "Airbus in China:\n\tAirbus first established an official presence in China in 1994. Since then, rapid growth has been the hallmark of Airbus\u2019 Chinese operations, with the company having expanded its number of commercial jetliners sold to the country by a factor of 50 in less than two decades. The company delivered its 1,000th commercial jetliner in 2013 and aims to reach its 2,000th by 2020, pushing its market share above 50%. With the fast development of its aerospace and aviation industry, China is on track to become the world\u2019s largest aviation market and it is already a major customer of Airbus products, with Chinese deliveries representing nearly a quarter of the company\u2019s global commercial aircraft production. Airbus values not only its relationship with airlines and helicopter operators in China, it also appreciates the enormous value offered by Chinese industry; components produced by Chinese companies are currently found on all production Airbus commercial jetliner types. The total value of the Airbus and Chinese cooperation reached around $500 million in 2015. Beyond its role as both customer and supplier, China is a strategic partner as well, as evidenced by the fact that Airbus\u2019 first final assembly line, or FAL, outside the borders of its four founding European countries was opened in the city of Tianjin in 2008. This FAL produces the A320 single-aisle family of passenger aircraft, and was joined by a Completion and Delivery Centre in 2017 for the A330, marking Airbus\u2019 first widebody jetliner centre outside of its founding countries. \n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tBy late 2017, there were more than 1,500 Airbus commercial jetliners in service in China, and deliveries to the country represent nearly a quarter of Airbus\u2019 total jetliner production. Helping make this possible are more than 1,900 employees in China that work for Airbus and its joint ventures on commercial aircraft in multiple locations across the country. Many of these employees work at the final assembly line in Tianjin. Opened in 2008, the Chinese FAL is a joint venture between Airbus and a consortium of Tianjin Free Trade Zone (TJFTZ) and China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC). As part of this framework, a new Airbus A330 Completion and Delivery Centre (C&DC) in Tianjin was inaugurated in 2017. The C&DC, co-located at the same site as the A320 Family FAL and the Airbus Tianjin Delivery Centre, is Airbus\u2019 first widebody centre outside of Europe. The facility performs A330 completion activities that include cabin installation, aircraft painting, production flight tests, customer acceptance and aircraft delivery.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tAirbus has been China\u2019s No. 1 helicopter partner for more than 50 years, a long-lasting relationship that began in 1967 with the delivery of an Alouette III rotorcraft. Airbus\u2019 helicopter division is the leader in China with a 40% market share as of late 2017. In June 2016, a Chinese consortium ordered 100 H135 light-twin utility helicopters in an agreement that included the construction of an H135 final assembly line (FAL) in Qingdao, Shandong province. Construction began in May, 2017 for what will become the first H135 FAL outside of Europe, as well as the first helicopter final assembly in the country established by a Western helicopter manufacturer. The historic FAL agreement builds on the joint development effort involving Airbus and China\u2019s Avicopter for the H175 medium utility helicopter. Based on an agreement signed in 2014, more than 1,000 of these rotorcraft are envisioned for production over a 20-year timeframe, with the twin-engine helicopter being produced at Airbus\u2019 facility in Marignane, France and in the city of Harbin in northeast China. As of late 2017, Airbus had offices in seven different locations in China for its helicopter-related activities, including a regional customer service centre and logistics platform at Hong Kong airport. Airbus is also one of the major shareholders of CGAMEC, a maintenance company based in Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong, that handles the company\u2019s helicopter maintenance, repair and overhaul activities in China. A full flight simulator for the H225 \u2013 a member of Airbus\u2019 well known Super Puma helicopter family \u2013 was installed in 2012 within the Airbus Hua-Ou training centre in Beijing.\n\tDefence:\t\n\t\tAirbus has forged valuable links with a variety of companies to help it provide better service to a growing local customer base in several areas, while adhering to limitations on military technology. The company has won a number of major contracts in the field of radio communication systems, including providing integrated solutions that guaranteed the security of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Airbus has also deployed TETRA radio systems in airports and metro lines across the country.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tAirbus has been an engaged participant in China\u2019s use of space for Earth observation. The company has also worked with a private partner, Beijing Eastdawn Information Technology (which itself is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), to distribute satellite imagery and software to government agencies and other customers.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tWith headquarters half a world away, Airbus recognises the value that strong partnerships with local Chinese companies provides. A sampling of these partnerships includes a composite manufacturing centre in Harbin, while in Beijing alone, there is an engineering centre; a customer support centre that can dispatch some 25,000 spare parts to airlines in the Asia-Pacific region; and a training centre with five full flight simulators for the A320 and A330/A340 jetliner families and the H225 helicopter.\n\tChina's future:\n\t\tChina is poised to become the world\u2019s largest aviation market in the future, and Airbus is committed to being there every step of the way. The company aims to reach 2,000 aircraft delivered to the country by 2020, pushing its market share above 50%. Recent reforms passed in China will help open lower-altitude airspace in the coming years, handing flight control from the military to civil aviation authorities. With only 900 or so civil helicopters in service in the whole of China (as of late 2017), this will lead to tremendous possibilities for growth; Airbus is well positioned to help put the country on the path to become the world\u2019s largest rotorcraft market with more than 150 deliveries per year expected by 2020."}, {"title": "Airbus_in_Finland.txt", "text": "Airbus in Finland:\n\tMore than 330 highly-skilled employees work at Airbus in Finland, primarily in the area of research and development (R&D), engineering and project management.

Airbus boosted its presence in Latin America in 1998 when Chile-based LAN Airlines, El Salvador-based TACA Airlines and Brazil-based TAM Airlines placed what was at the time the largest joint order in Latin American commercial aviation history for 90 single-aisle aircraft, with options for an additional 90. Since then, these airlines combined have ordered nearly 600 A320 Family aircraft, recognized as the benchmark single-aisle aircraft family. With a robust and growing presence in more than two dozen countries and territories, Airbus employs approximately 1,000 people across Latin America and the Caribbean and is proud to promote local aviation professionals at its training and manufacturing centres throughout Latin America.\n\tCommercial aircraft: \n\t\tWith more than 1,200 aircraft sold in the region and over 650 yet to be delivered (as of the end of 2017), Airbus has become a market leader in commercial aircraft product lines in the Latin America and Caribbean market \u2013 and has secured more than 60 percent of net orders in the region since 1990. Over 650 of its aircraft were in operation during 2017 with over 20 customers and operators. Airbus has tripled the regional in-service fleet with airlines in the 10 years. LATAM Airlines Group, a result of the 2012 merger between Chile-based LAN Airlines and Brazil-based TAM Airlines, is the largest Airbus customer in the Southern Hemisphere and among the largest Airbus airline customers worldwide. In January 2016, LATAM Airlines Group began to operate the first of its 27 A350 XWB aircraft on order, becoming the initial airline in the Americas to fly the highly efficient widebody airliner. In August 2016, the group took delivery of the Americas\u2019 first A320neo. Colombian airline Avianca has based its fleet modernization and expansion plans on Airbus aircraft. In 2015, the company purchased 100 A320neo jetliners in what was at the time the single largest order in Latin American aviation history. In 2012, Avianca Cargo, formerly known as Tampa Cargo, became the region\u2019s first operator of the A330-200 freighter \u2013 a derivative of the widebody A330 passenger airliner. Synergy Aerospace Corp, Avianca\u2019s largest shareholder and owner of Avianca Brasil, became an Airbus customer in 2007 with its order for 10 A350 XWB widebody jetliners and also has signed a purchase agreement for 62 A320neo Family aircraft. In addition to LATAM, Avianca and Avianca Brasil's wide-body presence, Aerolineas Argentina has a total of 15 A330 and A340 in operation and Brazil\u2019s Azul Airlines operates seven A330-200 and will receive its first A330neo in late 2018. Other wide-body operators in the region are TAME, Avior and Surinam Airways. The low-cost carrier business model is rapidly growing in Latin America and includes carriers such as Viva Air, which committed to the purchase of 50 A320 Family aircraft in late 2017, and Mexico\u2019s VivaAerobus \u2013 which in 2013 made the then-largest purchase by a Mexican airline of 52 single-aisle A320 Family aircraft. Mexico\u2019s Volaris and Chile\u2019s JetSMART were part of Airbus\u2019 all-time record acquisition announcement in 2017 as they were among the four airlines covered by a Memorandum of Understanding with Indigo Partners for the combined total purchase of 430 Airbus A320 Family airliners. With the opening of Airbus training and maintenance centres in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, Airbus is responding to its customers\u2019 demand for training while directly supporting their growth and productivity.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 helicopter division has a four-decade presence in Latin America. With a fleet of more than 1,400 rotorcraft in service across the region, Airbus helicopters make up nearly a third of the operating fleet in this area of the world. The Airbus customer centre network, with bases in Mexico, Brazil and Chile, ensures continuous support to its helicopter types flying in Latin America and the Caribbean and employs approximately 1,150 people. From the H125 single-engine rotorcraft to the multi-purpose heavyweight H225M, Airbus\u2019 helicopters are in service with most of the continent\u2019s military services. The highly successful Super Puma/Cougar family H225 and H215 rotorcraft, for example, are operated in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina and Bolivia. Airbus has also supplied 10 AS565 Panthers MBe to the Mexican Navy, which became the world launch operator of this new version. In the civil sector, several rotorcraft models are used in public service and commercial activities such as medical emergency transport, airborne law enforcement, transport missions for the energy industry, and private and corporate aviation. Operated throughout Latin America is the single-engine H125 light utility helicopter: famed for its performance in \u2018high and hot\u2019 conditions, this rotorcraft is commonly used for airborne law enforcement and diverse aerial work missions, as well as for private business aviation. The light twin-engine H145 performs police missions including support to populations affected by natural disasters and gives support to the energy/mining industry. The new super-medium H175 has been successfully deployed in the Gulf of Mexico serving the oil and gas industry. Airbus has launched several industrial cooperation programs that have greatly contributed to the development of the region\u2019s aviation industry. Brazil \u2013 home to a state-of-the-art engineering and design centre and final assembly lines for H125 and H225 rotorcraft \u2013 and Mexico \u2013 with a new 13,000-square metre industrial facility producing aeronautical metallic components \u2013 are good examples of the company\u2019s active role in industrial cooperation and transfer of technology in the region. In addition to the in-house support and services offer provided by its subsidiaries, Airbus has created an accredited network of helicopter maintenance centres in several Latin American countries, including Argentina, Guatemala, Panama and Peru. Airbus also offers initial training for technicians and pilots.\n\tDefence:\n\t\tAs of late 2017, Airbus had sold some 150 transport aircraft from its C212, CN235 and C295 product lines to the armed forces of 13 countries in the region: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Surinam, Uruguay and Venezuela. Mexico is the largest operator of Airbus military transport aircraft in Latin America, with 22 airlifters flying as of late 2017, followed by Colombia and Brazil. Acquisitions by Mexico include the Mexican Navy\u2019s (SEMAR) purchase of the latest C295 version, the C295W. With a contract signed in the late 1970s, Chile was one of the first countries to place an order with the original CASA company \u2013 forerunner to Airbus \u2013 with the country\u2019s orders during this long-term relationship covering the C212, CN235 and C295. In the homeland security sector, Airbus played a key role in guaranteeing public safety during the 2014 FIFA World Cup sports competition in Brazil through a secure mobile radio communication system for professional users.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tAirbus builds satellites systems that keep Latin America connected and provide space-eye views on the region for both civil and military applications. In the Earth observation sector is Per\u00faSAT-1 \u2013 a 430 kg.-class satellite built by Airbus for the Peruvian CONIDA space agency and delivered in a record time of less than two years. Equipped with a submetric optical imager also designed and developed by Airbus, the satellite was developed for a wide range of applications ranging from homeland security and border monitoring to disaster management and environmental protection. The most powerful Earth observation satellite operated from Latin America, Per\u00faSAT-1 is based on Airbus\u2019 AstroBus-S platform, the latest generation of high-end satellites. The satellite was lofted in September 2016 by a light-lift Vega launcher operated by Arianespace. Airbus also built the first Earth observation system ever launched for Latin America, the Chilean satellite system FaSat Charlie (Sistema Satelital para Observaci\u00f3n de la Tierra, or SSOT). Orbited in late 2011, the satellite has exceeded its expected five-year functional life. An example of Airbus relay platforms at the service of Latin America is SKY Brasil-1 (also known as SKYB-1), based on the company\u2019s Eurostar E3000 platform. This high-definition television (HDTV) broadcast satellite is used by the DIRECTV Latin America subsidiary of AT&T/DIRECTTV, and offers coverage over Brazil. SKY Brasil-1 was orbited in February 2017 by a heavy-lift Ariane 5 launcher operated by Arianespace \u2013 a subsidiary of ArianeGroup, the joint venture of Airbus and Safran. Another relay platform is SES-10, produced by Airbus for Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES. Launched in 2017, this Eurostar E3000-based spacecraft is used by SES to offer replacement and additional capacity for direct-to-home TV broadcasting, enterprise and mobility services to Central America and South America, Mexico and the Caribbean. \n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 approach to evolve local capabilities in the regions where it does business is illustrated by the Per\u00faSAT-1 imaging satellite, which is part of comprehensive programme that also includes an Airbus-built ground control and image reception and processing segment in the Peruvian National Centre for Satellite Imagery Operation (CNOIS). One of the project\u2019s goals is to develop Peru\u2019s competence in space technologies, satellite operation and appropriate imaging applications, for which Airbus is supplying images from its fleet of optical and radar satellites. More than 80 Peruvian specialists took part in a technology transfer program with Airbus at its Toulouse, France facilities, and in Lima. This gave Peru access to the necessary knowledge and expertise for successful independent operation and maintenance of the Per\u00faSAT-1 systems.\n\tCorporate citizenship:\n\t\tWith the goal of delivering humanitarian aid after a devastating natural disaster, the Airbus Foundation and its customers regularly join forces to provide much-needed humanitarian support. After the devastating 2017 earthquake in Mexico, the Airbus Foundation partnered with Mexican airlines Volaris and Interjet to deliver more than nine tonnes of supplies that included clothes, blankets, tents, tarps, lanterns and medical supplies. LATAM and Azul Brazilian Airlines partnered with the Foundation in a first-of-its kind collaboration to help the victims of devastating Chilean forest fires by transporting relief supplies, and Avianca has partnered with the Foundation to help victims of mudslides in Colombia. Goodwill flights are not the only way the Airbus Foundation provides support to nations impacted by natural disasters. After the 2017 earthquake in Mexico, the Foundation partnered with air ambulance service Angel Flight to provide helicopter emergency transport with two light helicopters of the Ecureuil family \u2013 an AS355 and an H130 \u2013 that were made available to hospitals for the transfer of the critically injured, as well as transportation of food and medicine after the quake rendered many roads impassable. In addition, Airbus Earth-observation satellite images were made available to Foundation partners through a dedicated portal to help assess damage.\n\tLatin America's Future:\n\t\tEconomic indicators remain strong across Latin America and the Caribbean. With well-established democracies in place, increasing urbanisation and rapidly improving infrastructure, the region\u2019s economy is predicted to grow above the world average in the coming decades. The in-service fleet of commercial aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to more than double in the next 20 years, resulting in a need for nearly 50,000 new pilots and more than 53,000 new maintenance engineers. By 2036, the region\u2019s current regional mega cities of Bogot\u00e1, Buenos Aires, Lima, Mexico City, Santiago and S\u00e3o Paulo will be joined by Canc\u00fan, Panama City, and Rio de Janeiro. Together, these nine megacities will account for some 150,000 long-haul passengers daily. Airbus\u2019 long-term prospects for the region are optimistic as the helicopter fleet is estimated to grow 65 percent over the next 20 years resulting in the need of 2,000 new helicopters. The energy sector as well as the public services and  the private transport segments are bound to be particularly dynamic with the H125, H145, H215 and H225 being very well positioned due to their excellent performance in hot and high environments and optimized operational costs. The new H160, which will enter into service next year, is already attracting interest from private customers all over the region thanks to its highly stylized design and state of the art technology."}, {"title": "Airbus_in_Russia.txt", "text": "Airbus in Russia:\n\tOver the past 25 years, Airbus commercial aircraft, helicopters and space products have all established a strong presence in Russia. The country is well known for its aerospace research and technology and has proven a fertile ground for industrial cooperation with Airbus. As both a commercial market and a source of partnerships, Russia continues to be important to Airbus.\n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tAirbus first established relationships with a Russia airline in 1991, and the following year, the twin-engine widebody A310 entered into service with Russian national carrier Aeroflot. The A310 became the first Western-built aircraft to receive Russian type certification. When the first Airbus A320 Family aircraft entered commercial service in the country in 2003, the company\u2019s best-selling single-aisle product quickly gained popularity among Russian airlines due to its high fuel efficiency, low operating costs and unprecedented passenger comfort. As of early 2018, more than 310 Airbus aircraft are in service in Russia, a figure that represents more than half of the Western-produced fleet of 100-plus seat aircraft in the country. As the market grows, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States will need an estimated 1,200 new passenger aircraft by 2036. Airbus maintains a customer support centre in Moscow tasked with helping Airbus customers operate their fleet safely, comfortably and profitably. In conjunction with offices in Toulouse, France, the support centre provides technical assistance to all operators of Airbus jetliners in Russia and the CIS, whether flying aircraft directly purchased from Airbus or flown on lease. The centre also regularly sets up seminars and conferences for Airbus customers dedicated to various support topics as well as new Airbus services and tools aimed at simplifying the work of technical staff. Airbus manages several projects with the Interstate Aviation Committee, the Russian Civil Aviation Authorities, and the ministry of Transport of Russia and participates in numerous seminars and conferences on the development of flight safety.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tSome 210 Airbus-built rotorcraft were in operation in Russia in the beginning of 2018, and another 70-plus can be found in the countries making up the Commonwealth of Independent States. With a 48 percent market share, Airbus is the largest manufacturer of Western-built turbine-powered helicopters in Russia, and supplies approximately half of the country\u2019s VIP and corporate helicopters as well. Airbus Helicopters Vostok, a wholly-owned Airbus subsidiary, was founded in 2006; it offers a full product portfolio ranging from single-engine light helicopters to medium and heavy transport helicopters. The company has partnered with prominent operators such as the Moscow Aviation Centre, which has a fleet of five light-twin H145s configured for emergency medical services. Airbus is the country\u2019s largest manufacturer of Western-built turbine-powered helicopters in operation in terms of market share. Close strategic partnerships are a key Airbus priority within Russia, as demonstrated by UTair \u2013 one of Russia\u2019s major airlines \u2013 which is operating Airbus rotary-wing aircraft in harsh Siberian conditions. Gazpromavia Aviation has successfully operated eight light-twin H135s in difficult conditions with an excellent fleet availability rate, demonstrating the perfect adaptability of Airbus helicopters for pipeline surveillance and utility missions. Airbus is the only Western manufacturer to offer this level of presence and availability and also is the first to have a Russian partner: Transas, which supplied avionics for the eight H135s, purchased by Gazpromavia before becoming the H135\u2019s avionics supplier upon request. In 2015, Airbus Helicopters Vostok initiated a new strategy involving the creation of a network of maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, and distribution centres for light helicopters. This brought the company\u2019s services in Russia to a new level and added convenience for customers. Heliports of Russia was the first licensed MRO and distribution centre.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tSignificant cooperation with Russia on space projects began in the mid-1990s with the creation of Eurockot, a joint venture between Airbus and Khrunichev Space Centre. The partnership was designed for the promotion and marketing of the Russian small launcher Rockot in the European institutional and commercial markets. Starsem is a joint venture that manages the industrial and commercial exploitation of the Soyuz launch vehicle in the global launch vehicle market; it focuses on the delivery of small satellites and satellite constellations to low- and medium-altitude Earth orbits. In 2005, the Synertech joint venture of Airbus and Russian Space Systems was created to deliver reliable satellite equipment for Russian civil space programs; its production of power amplifiers was officially launched in 2016. Airbus and RSC Energia created the Energia Satellite Technologies joint venture in 2013 to deepen cooperation in the field of satellites. The two companies began collaborating in the early 1990s with equipment supplied to the Mir space station and have continued since, including work on the International Space Station.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tJust as important as the products Airbus sells within Russia are the more than 25 years of industrial cooperation with the country; current cooperation programmes range from material sourcing to engineering and component manufacturing. In 2003, the Airbus Engineering Centre, known as ECAR, was set up in Moscow as a joint venture between Airbus and the Kaskol industrial group. It was Airbus\u2019 first engineering facility outside its home countries and, as of early 2018, employed more than 200 Russian engineers. In this timeframe, ECAR had completed more than 100 projects for Airbus, and work is continuing on the A350-1000, A320neo and A330neo jetliner programmes.

All UH-72A Lakotas are manufactured at a purpose-built production facility in Columbus, Mississippi that includes the Lakota assembly line, flight line, paint shop, warehouse, administrative offices, flight operations and flight test engineering. As of 2017, Airbus had delivered 400-plus \u201cmade in America\u201d UH-72A Lakotas, all on time and on budget. The potential total program life-cycle value of the Lakota program is more than $2.5 billion. In addition to the UH-72A\u2019s deployment by U.S. Army and Army National Guard units for border security, surveillance/reconnaissance, medical evacuations, VIP transport and disaster response, the Lakota is utilized by the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School for training and qualification. Another important rotorcraft for the protection of the United States is the twin-engine Airbus HH-65 Dolphin. Approximately 100 HH-65s are in the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s fleet where they are utilized for homeland security missions \u2013 assigned to coastal locations throughout the U.S. Also for the U.S. Coast Guard, Airbus has supplied 18 HC-144A Ocean Sentry maritime patrol aircraft, which are derived from the company\u2019s CN235 twin-engine multi-role tactical transport. In September 2017, the HC-144A fleet surpassed 100,000 flight hours in U.S. Coast Guard service, performing thousands of search, rescue and law enforcement missions (including drug interdiction), and contributing to post-hurricane disaster response efforts. Among the Ocean Sentry\u2019s base locations is the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s Aviation Training Center and air station at Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama. At this facility, Airbus DS Military Aircraft, Inc., provides critical customer support for C212 and CN235 operators worldwide.

Additionally, on multilevel secure voice networks (DRSN), it can be configured to interoperate with multilevel secure voice switches.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tAirbus is recognized as a world leader in satellite-delivered geo-information. Its access to Earth observation satellite imagery \u2013 including company-built spacecraft in orbit \u2013 combine with decades of experience in one organization, enabling Airbus to provide premium satellite imagery, products and services. Airbus is applying its in-orbit operational expertise for the service module that is to equip NASA\u2019s human-rated Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. The service module will support astronaut crews, handling duties for propulsion while also providing the water and oxygen needed for a habitable environment, along with storing electrical power and maintaining the temperature of the vehicle's systems and components. In March 2017, OneWeb Satellites\u2019 broke ground on a high-volume satellite manufacturing facility at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. OneWeb Satellites is a joint venture between OneWeb, a satellite-based global network provider and Airbus Defence and Space, along with the world\u2019s second largest space company. The ambitious goal of the project is to fully bridge the \u2018digital divide\u2019 by 2027, making internet access available and affordable for everyone. The expertise of Airbus in space exploration also makes it a valuable partner for the United States. On the James Webb Space Telescope \u2013 which will become the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) premier orbital observatory \u2013 Airbus is providing the Near Infrared Spectrograph instrument capable of detecting the faintest radiation from distant galaxies. This massive telescope will be orbited by an Ariane 5, the European launch vehicle built under the responsibility of production prime contractor ArianeGroup (a joint venture of Airbus and France\u2019s Safran). The U.S. Air Force has acquired five Eagle Vision systems \u2013 Airbus\u2019 commercial, off-the-shelf deployable ground station that receives non-classified satellite imagery. The system meets requirements ranging from mission planning and predictive battle space awareness to determining air mobility requirements at airfields and the assessment of natural disaster areas.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus continues to grow its business network in the United States, focusing on innovation and disruptive technologies. Airbus Americas subsidiary Metron Aviation, based in Ashburn, Virginia, provides advanced Air Traffic Management production and services to the global aviation industry. Airbus Aerial in Atlanta, Georgia was launched in May 2017 as an aerial services start-up. The company unites imagery from unmanned and manned aircraft and from the Airbus constellation of satellites with analytics and machine learning, through a cloud-based software platform to help commercial customers solve a range of problems. A3 (\u201cA Cubed\u201d) in Silicon Valley, California was launched in 2015 to disrupt Airbus and the industry. The business currently offers three primary products: Vahana is a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle; Voom is an on-demand helicopter service for urban areas; and Transpose is a modularized aircraft cabin system design to minimize cost and transition time when refreshing commercial aircraft interiors. Opened in 2016, the Airbus Experience Center in Washington D.C. is a collection of interactive, multimedia exhibitions highlighting the extensive role the company plays in the U.S. aerospace and defense industries, as well as visually featuring the continuing evolution of technology in the industry worldwide. The Experience Center also serves as a hub for gatherings of industry groups from around the world, providing high-tech event and office facilities in the center of the Nation\u2019s Capital. "}, {"title": "Airbus_in_Turkey.txt", "text": "Airbus in Turkey:\n\tAirbus and Turkey have a long history of successful collaboration in civil and military aviation. For nearly 30 years, Airbus has been an important partner for the country, working closely with flag carrier Turkish Airlines, the Ministry of Defence and Undersecretary for Defence Industries, as well as Turkey\u2019s air force, navy and coast guard. Investments and partnerships \u2013 which have created more than 3,000 jobs in Turkey as of mid-2018 \u2013 have only strengthened the relationship and will continue to do so as the country\u2019s industrial workforce steadily grows. By the year 2020, Airbus will have invested nearly $2.5 billion in Turkey and by 2030, that figure will soar to over $5 billion. These investments have returned concrete dividends: every commercial and military Airbus aircraft flying today has parts produced by Turkish suppliers. Not only are components manufactured in Turkey, but increasingly so are more complex major assemblies. Turkish suppliers also have assumed design responsibilities for such parts and assemblies as ailerons for the A350 XWB Family and control surfaces for a number of commercial and military aircraft platforms.\n\tCommercial aircraft:\n\t\tTurkey is Airbus\u2019 fourth-largest customer in Europe, with some 270 passenger and freighter aircraft in service with nine operators (as of 2018), with more on order. Airbus aircraft share cockpit and operational commonality, allowing airlines to use the same pool of pilots, cabin crews and maintenance engineers, while bringing operational flexibility that results in significant cost savings. Several airlines in Turkey benefit from these advantages by operating more than one Airbus aircraft type in their fleet. According to Airbus\u2019 Global Market Forecast for 2018-2037, passenger numbers on domestic routes will triple in the country over the next 20 years, with soaring demand for over 900 aircraft. With approximately 270 Airbus passenger and freighter aircraft in service with nine operators, Turkey is Airbus\u2019 fourth-largest customer in Europe.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tTurkey has proved an important market for Airbus helicopters. Significant military contracts were signed in the 1990s for the delivery of AS532 Cougar helicopters to the Turkish armed forces. As of mid-2018, Turkey is the world\u2019s largest Cougar operator with a fleet of 46 such helicopters operated by the Turkish Land Forces and the Air Force for general purpose and search-and-rescue missions. Airbus has a strong presence in the parapublic emergency medical services segment in Turkey with 13 H135 helicopters operated by the Turkish Aeronautical Association for the needs of the Turkish Ministry of Health across the country. Several civil Airbus helicopter models also are flying in Turkey, such as the single-engine H130 and twin-engine H145, used in roles that include passenger transport and business aviation.\n\tDefence:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 defence and security presence in Turkey was established in 2013, providing sales and marketing support, along with support in the contractual, material and services sectors. This operation is actively playing a role in services and modernisation for the Turkish Air Force\u2019s A400M multi-role airlifter, as well as providing material support for the CN235 tactical transport. The Turkish Armed Forces are one of the pioneer air forces operating the A400M airlifter and also fly the largest fleet of CN235 transport aircraft. Every commercial and military Airbus aircraft flying today has parts produced by Turkish suppliers.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tIn late 2017, Airbus was awarded the contract for the T\u00fcrksat 5A and 5B telecommunication satellites, which are based on the latest Electric Orbit Raising (EOR) version of its highly-reliable Eurostar E3000 platform. The company continues along its path to become an integral part of the Turkish space industry by supporting various projects. Indeed, Airbus is uniquely positioned as a potential partner with the future Turkish Space Agency, able to open the door to the European Space Agency with perspectives encompassing research, development and commercial opportunities.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tTurkish aeronautical industries work to ensure the highest level of capabilities and skills, and Airbus is likewise focused on the continued development of long-term aviation cooperation projects. Rate increases for the A320 and A350 XWB jetliner families will create additional jobs, and Turkish aeronautical industries will benefit from added responsibilities resulting from the continuous development of its strategic skills. Airbus has seven major industrial partners and subsidiaries in Turkey.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 goal is to continuously push the boundaries for new and better methods to apply the most advanced technology to continuously innovate its products, business and services. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and Airbus signed, in September 2018, a Cooperation and Research agreement to co-develop and engage in research and experimentation in aircraft secondary structures, such as movable parts, for Airbus programs. By combining resources and knowledge to develop data-driven capabilities, TAI and Airbus will gain insights into advanced manufacturing methods for cost-effective and environmentally-friendly aircraft. Launched in January 2018 by Turkish Airlines, \u0130bn Haldun University and Airbus, \u201cAir Transport Management Master\u2019s Program\u201d is a comprehensive 18-month academic course designed to provide future aviation executives with sufficient capabilities to run the region\u2019s fast-growing aerospace industry. The program is endowed by globally reputable institutions like Cranfield University and British Columbia University, and is held at the Turkish Airlines Aviation Academy Campus.\n\tTurkey's Future:\n\t\tAirbus considers Turkey a strategic industrial partner and is committed to long-term, mutually-beneficial industrial cooperation through the placement of work packages that include technology transfers. Such transfers help build skills and competencies in the country\u2019s aviation industry. Airbus\u2019 Global Market Forecast for 2018-2037 predicts that over the coming 20 years, passenger traffic to, from and within Turkey will more than triple. Airbus is extremely well-positioned to meet this demand with its eco-efficient, modern aircraft families, and Turkish aerospace companies are equally well-positioned to benefit from this growth through long-term industrial partnerships with Airbus. Technology transfers and the expansion of Turkey\u2019s aviation industry know-how underpin Airbus\u2019 long-term commitment to the country.\n"}, {"title": "General_information.txt", "text": "General information:\n\tAirbus SE, from 2000 to 2014 known as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), is a European aerospace corporation, registered in the Netherlands and trading shares in France, Germany and Spain. It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures in multiple countries both inside and outside of the European Union. The company has three divisions: Commercial Aircraft, Defence and Space, and Helicopters, the third being the largest in its industry in terms of revenues and turbine helicopter deliveries.The company's main civil aeroplane business is based in Blagnac, France, a suburb of Toulouse, with production and manufacturing facilities mainly in France, Germany, Spain, China, United Kingdom and the United States. Final assembly production is based at Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Seville, Spain; Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, United States. The company produces and markets the first commercially viable digital fly-by-wire airliner, the Airbus A320, and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380. The 10,000th aircraft, an A350, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 14 October 2016. The global Airbus fleet have performed more than 110 million flights, totaling over 215 billion kilometres and carrying 12 billion passengers. Airbus's corporate headquarters is located in Leiden, Netherlands, and the main office is located in Toulouse, France. The company is led by CEO Thomas Enders and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.\n\tFormerly:\n\t\tPre-2017 parent company:\n\t\tEuropean Aeronautic Defence and Space Company NV (2000\u20132014), Airbus Group NV (2014\u20132015), Airbus Group SE (2015\u20132017)\n\t\tPre-2017 subsidiary:\n\t\tAirbus Industrie GIE (1970\u20132001), Airbus SAS (2001\u20132017)\n\tHistory:\n\t\tThe current company is the product of consolidation in the European aerospace industry tracing back to the formation of the Airbus Industrie GIE consortium in 1970. In 2000, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) NV was established. In addition to other subsidiaries pertaining to security and space activities, EADS owned 100% of the pre-existing Eurocopter SA, established in 1992, as well as 80% of Airbus Industrie GIE. In 2001, Airbus Industrie GIE was reorganised as Airbus SAS, a simplified joint-stock company. In 2006, EADS acquired BAE Systems's remaining 20% of Airbus. EADS NV was renamed Airbus Group NV and SE in 2014, and 2015, respectively.Due to the dominance of the Airbus SAS division within Airbus Group SE, these parent and subsidiary companies were merged in January 2017, keeping the name of the parent company. The company was given its present name in April 2017.\n\tLogo:\n\t\tThe logos of Airbus Industrie GIE and Airbus SAS displayed a stylised turbine symbol, redolent of a jet engine, and a font similar to Helvetica Black. The logo colours were reflected in the standard Airbus aircraft livery in each period. The EADS logo between 2000 and 2010 combined the logos of the merged companies, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (a four-ray star) and A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra (a curved arrow), after which these elements were removed and a new font with 3D shading was chosen. This font was retained in the logos of Airbus Group NV (2014\u20132015) and Airbus Group SE (2015\u20132017), then Airbus SE:\n\tCivilian products:\n\t\tThe Airbus product line started with the A300, the world's first twin-aisle, twin-engined aircraft. A shorter, re-winged, re-engined variant of the A300 is known as the A310. Building on its success, Airbus launched the A320, particularly notable for being the first commercial jet to use a fly-by-wire control system. The A320 has been, and continues to be, a great commercial success. The A318 and A319 are shorter derivatives with some of the latter under construction for the corporate business jet market as Airbus Corporate Jets. A stretched version is known as the A321. The A320 family's primary competitor is the Boeing 737 family. The longer-range widebody products\u2014 the twin-jet A330 and the four-engine A340\u2014 have efficient wings, enhanced by winglets. The Airbus A340-500 has an operating range of 16,700 kilometres (9,000 nmi), the second longest range of any commercial jet after the Boeing 777-200LR (range of 17,446 km or 9,420 nautical miles). All Airbus aircraft developed since then have cockpit systems similar to the A320, making it easier to train crew. Production of the four-engine A340 was ended in 2011 due to lack of sales compared to its twin-engine counterparts, such as the Boeing 777. Airbus is studying a replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\". Those studies indicated a maximum fuel efficiency gain of 9\u201310% for the NSR. Airbus however opted to enhance the existing A320 design using new winglets and working on aerodynamical improvements. This \"A320 Enhanced\" should have a fuel efficiency improvement of around 4\u20135%, shifting the launch of an A320 replacement to 2017\u20132018. On 24 September 2009, the COO Fabrice Bregier stated to Le Figaro that the company would need from \u20ac800 million to \u20ac1 billion over six years to develop the new aircraft generation and preserve the company technological lead from new competitors like the Chinese Comac C919,[24] scheduled to operate by 2015\u20132020. In July 2007, Airbus delivered its last A300 to FedEx, marking the end of the A300/A310 production line. Airbus intends to relocate Toulouse A320 final assembly activity to Hamburg, and A350/A380 production in the opposite direction as part of its Power8 organisation plan begun under ex-CEO Christian Streiff. Airbus supplied replacement parts and service for Concorde until its retirement in 2003. The Airbus Corporate Jets markets and modifies new aircraft for private and corporate customers. It has a model range that parallels the commercial aircraft offered by the company, ranging from the A318 Elite to the double-deck Airbus A380 Prestige. Following the entry of the 737 based Boeing Business Jet, Airbus joined the business jet market with the A319 Corporate Jet in 1997. Although the term Airbus Corporate jet was initially used only for the A319CJ, it is now often used for all models, including the VIP widebodies. As of December 2008, 121 corporate and private jets are operating, 164 aircraft have been ordered, including an A380 Prestige and 107 A320 family Corporate Jet.\n\tConsumer products:\n\t\tIn June 2013, Airbus announced that it was developing a range of \"smart suitcases\" known as Bag2Go for air travellers, in conjunction with luggage-maker Rimowa and IT firm T-Systems. The cases feature a collection of built-in electronic gadgets which communicate with a smartphone app and with the IT systems of the airline, to assist the traveller and improve reliability and security of baggage handling. Gadgets include a weighing scale and a location tracker, using GPS for location tracking, RFID for identification, and a SIM card for messaging. Since then, similar products have been announced by other companies.\n\tMilitary products:\n\t\tIn the late 1990s Airbus became increasingly interested in developing and selling to the military aviation market. It embarked on two main fields of development: aerial refuelling with the Airbus A310 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) and the Airbus A330 MRTT, and tactical airlift with the A400M. In January 1999 Airbus established a separate company, Airbus Military SAS, to undertake development and production of a turboprop-powered tactical transport aircraft, the Airbus Military A400M. The A400M is being developed by several NATO members, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the UK, as an alternative to relying on foreign aircraft for tactical airlift capacity, such as the Ukrainian Antonov An-124 Ruslan and the American C-130 Hercules. The A400M project has suffered several delays; Airbus has threatened to cancel the development unless it receives state subsidies. Pakistan placed an order for the Airbus A310 MRTT in 2008, which will be a conversion of an existing airframe as the base model A310 is no longer in production. On 25 February 2008 Airbus won an order for three air refuelling MRTT aircraft, adapted from A330 passenger jets, from the United Arab Emirates. On 1 March 2008 a consortium of Airbus and Northrop Grumman had won a $35 billion contract to build the new in-flight refuelling aircraft KC-45A, a US built version of the MRTT, for the USAF. The decision drew a formal complaint from Boeing, and the KC-X contract was cancelled to begin bidding afresh.\n\tNew supersonic passenger plane:\n\t\tIn September 2014, Aerion partnered with Airbus (mainly Airbus Defence) to collaborate on designing the Aerion AS2, a supersonic 11-seater private business jet, hoping for a market entry in 2021.\n\tEnvironmental record:\n\t\tAirbus has committed to the \"Flightpath 2050\", an aviation industry plan to reduce noise, CO2, and NOx emissions. Airbus was the first aerospace business to become ISO 14001 certified, in January 2007; this is a broader certification covering the whole organisation, not just the aircraft it produces. In association with Honeywell and JetBlue Airbus has developed a biofuel to reduce pollution and dependence on fossil fuels, claiming that this has the potential to replace up to a third of the world's aviation fuel. Algae-based biofuel absorbs carbon dioxide during growth and does not compete with food production. This alternative may be commercially available by 2030 but algae and other vegetation-based fuels are in an early stage of development and fuel-bearing algae has been expensive to develop. Airbus offers delivery flights to airlines using a 10% biofuel blend in standard engines. The fuel does not cut carbon emissions but is free of sulphur emissions and demonstrates that the fuel could be used in commercial flights in unmodified engines.\n\tOrganisation:\n\t\tDivisions:\n\t\t\tCommercial aircraft:\n\t\t\t\tCommercial aircraft generated 67% of total revenue for the group in 2013.[55] The product portfolio of such aircraft encompasses short range models such as the A320 family and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380.\n\t\t\tDefence and Space:\n\t\t\t\tThe division Airbus Defence and Space was formed in January 2014 as part of the group restructuring from the former EADS divisions Airbus Military, Astrium, and Cassidian (composed of Cassidian Electronics \u2013 develops and manufactures sensors, radars, avionics and electronic warfare systems for military and security applications, Cassidian Air Systems \u2013 develops manned and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs), mission avionics, electronic defence and warning systems and Cassidian Systems \u2013 provides global security solutions such as command & control, lead system integration, TETRA and TETRAPOL communication systems for public safety, industry, transportation and defence. This line of business was the first one in the world to begin field tests with TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS).[56]).[57] EADS 3 Sigma \u2013 a Hellenic company focused in the design, development, production and services provision of airborne and surface target drone systems. The Airbus Military division, which manufactured tanker, transport and mission aircraft; Eurocopter, the world's largest helicopter supplier; Astrium, provided systems for aerial, land, naval and civilian security applications including Ariane, Galileo and Cassidian. Through Cassidian, EADS was a partner in the Eurofighter consortium as well as in the missile systems provider MBDA.\n\t\t\tHelicopters:\n\t\t\t\tAirbus Helicopters, formerly known as Eurocopter, is a helicopter manufacturing and support company. See also: Airbus Helicopters, Inc.\n\tInternational manufacturing presence:\n\t\tAirbus has several final assembly lines for different models and markets. These are:\n\t\tToulouse, France (A320, A330 family, A350 family and A380)\n\t\tHamburg, Germany (A318, A319, A320 and A321)\n\t\tSeville, Spain (A400M)\n\t\tTianjin, China (A319 and A320).\n\t\tMobile, Alabama, US (A319, A320 and A321)\n\t\tMirabel, Canada (A220)\n\t\tAirbus, however, has a number of other plants in different European locations, reflecting its foundation as a consortium. An original solution to the problem of moving aircraft parts between the different factories and the assembly plants is the use of the Airbus Beluga, a modified cargo aircraft capable of carrying entire sections of fuselage. This solution has also been investigated by Boeing, which retrofitted 4 747-400s to transport the components of the 787. An exception to this scheme is the A380, whose fuselage and wings are too large[67] for sections to be carried by the Beluga. Large A380 parts are brought by ship to Bordeaux, and then transported to the Toulouse assembly plant by the Itin\u00e9raire \u00e0 Grand Gabarit, a specially enlarged waterway and road route. Airbus opened an assembly plant in Tianjin, People's Republic of China for its A320 series airliners in 2009.[68][69][70] Airbus started constructing a $350 million component manufacturing plant in Harbin, China in July 2009, which will employ 1,000 people.[71][72][73] Scheduled to be operated by the end of 2010, the 30,000 square metre plant will manufacture composite parts and assemble composite work-packages for the A350 XWB, A320 families and future Airbus programmes. Harbin Aircraft Industry Group Corporation, Hafei Aviation Industry Company Ltd, AviChina Industry & Technology Company and other Chinese partners hold the 80% stake of the plant while Airbus control the remaining 20%.[74] North America is an important region to Airbus in terms of both aircraft sales and suppliers. 2,000 of the total of approximately 5,300 Airbus jetliners sold by Airbus around the world, representing every aircraft in its product line from the 107-seat A318 to the 565-passenger A380, are ordered by North American customers. According to Airbus, US contractors, supporting an estimated 120,000 jobs, earned an estimated $5.5 billion (2003) worth of business. For example, one version of the A380 has 51% American content in terms of work share value. Plans for a Mobile, Alabama aircraft assembly plant were unveiled by Airbus CEO Fabrice Br\u00e9gier from the Mobile Convention Centre on 2 July 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley for the assembly of the A220, A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. It could employ up to 1,000 full-time workers when operational. Construction began on 8 April 2013, and became operable by 2015,[75] producing up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017.[76][77]\n\tFinancial information:\n\t\tIn October 2005 the British Ministry of Defence warned European politicians to stop, as it sees it, interfering in the corporate governance of EADS. The former UK Defence Procurement Minister Lord Drayson hinted that the UK government, a major customer for EADS, may withhold future contracts. \"As a key customer, we see it as important for EADS to move in a direction that is free from political interference.\"[78] On 4 April 2006, DaimlerChrysler announced its intention to reduce its shareholding from 30\u2009% to 22.5\u2009%. The company places a value of the stake at \"approximately \u20ac2.0 billion.\"[79] Lagard\u00e8re will reduce its holding by an identical amount. However, Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, a unit of the French government, acquired 2.25\u2009% of EADS. At issue as a result is the fact that the German and French shareholdings are now in imbalance.[80] On 30 August 2006, shortly after the stock price decline caused by the A380 delivery delays, more than 5\u2009% of EADS stock has been reportedly purchased by the Russian state-owned Vneshtorgbank.[81] Now its share is nearly 6\u2009%. In December 2007, Vneshtorgbank sold EADS shares to another state-controlled bank Vneshekonombank. EADS sharers are to be delivered by Vneshekonombank to the charter capital of JSC \"United Aircraft Corporation\" in 2008.[citation needed] On 3 October 2006, shortly after EADS admitted further delays in the Airbus 380 programme would cost the company 4.8 billion euros in lost earnings in 2010, EADS shares, traded on the Paris arm of Euronext, were suspended after they surpassed the 10\u2009% loss limit. Trading resumed later in the day with the one-day loss holding at 7\u2009%.
