[{"atitle": "A220_family", "doc": "The Airbus A220, previously known as Bombardier CSeries (or C Series), is a family of narrow-body, twin-engine, medium-range jet airliners marketed by Airbus but designed and originally built by the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace. Following Airbus involvement the aircraft are built by CSeries Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP). The 108 to 133-seat A220-100 (formerly CS100) made its maiden flight on 16 September 2013, was awarded an initial type certification by Transport Canada on 18 December 2015 and entered service on 15 July 2016 with Swiss Global Air Lines. The 130 to 160-seat A220-300 (formerly CS300) first flew on 27 February 2015, received an initial type certification on 11 July 2016, and entered service with launch customer airBaltic on 14 December 2016. At service entry operators realized a 21% lower fuel burn for the CS300 in replacing 32-year-old Boeing 737-300s, with a dependability above 99.3%, and 25% lower costs than the RJ100 for the CS100, while the passengers' and pilots' feedback is positive for the cabin and flight controls. Airbus purchased a 50.01% majority stake in the CSeries program in October 2017, with the deal closing in July 2018. As part of the deal, Bombardier retained a 31% stake in the aircraft and Investissement Qu\u00e9bec retained a 19% stake. Airbus plans to open a second assembly line for the aircraft at its Mobile, Alabama factory. When Fokker, which produced the Fokker 100 100-seat short-haul aircraft, was in difficulty, discussions began with Bombardier on 5 February 1996. After evaluating Fokker's opportunities and challenges, Bombardier announced an end to the acquisition process on 27 February. which made its first flight in January 2002, as Boeing had the 737NG-600 first delivered in September 1998.\t\n\tA220-100:\n\t\tBuilt-in efficiency:\n\t\t\tThe smallest jetliner in Airbus\u2019 in-production product line, the A220-100 was built from the ground up to serve the 100-135 seat market with unbeatable efficiency and comfort. With broad seats, plenty of overhead storage space and large windows, it\u2019s a single-aisle aircraft that feels like a widebody jet. The extensive use of advanced aluminium in the fuselage \u2013 along with advanced composites in the wings, empennage and rear fuselage \u2013 reduces weight and increases corrosion resistance, resulting in better maintainability. These modern structural materials make up 70 percent of the aircraft\u2019s primary structure, delivering weight savings for reduced fuel burned, with an accompanying reduction of CO2 and NOx emissions. Powered by Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines specifically designed for the family, the A220-100 can connect distant airports with its 3,100 nm range and best-in-class airfield performance. Using a takeoff field length as short as 1,220 metres, the A220 Family is ideal for hot-and-high and city-centre airport operations; in fact, the A220-100 and A220-300 are the largest aircraft able to operate in the constrained environment of London City Airport. From such challenging airports, the A220 Family has a built-in advantage.\n\t\tPassenger comfort:\n\t\t\tBoasting one of the best views in the sky, the extra-large windows on the A220-100 are abundant \u2013 more than one per row \u2013 and the flying experience is a peaceful one. A220 Family aircraft are recognised for their low noise levels, providing a quiet cabin as well. Wide seats combined with ample overhead storage create personal space without compromise, and the cabin management system provides crews with easy, intuitive control of the aircraft\u2019s interior environment, including entertainment offerings and mood lighting to ensure a delightful passenger experience.\n\tA220-300:\n\t\tLean, economical and efficient:\n\t\t\tThe larger member of the A220 Family, the A220-300 was specifically designed and purpose-built for the 130-160 seat market, and is a member of the most efficient aircraft family in its class. The A220-300 represents the fusion of performance and technology in a family of jetliners that deliver 10 percent lower costs per trip than large single-aisle aircraft \u2013 allowing airlines to connect distant points on continents or sectors that were previously unprofitable or impossible. The A220-300\u2019s advanced aerodynamics combined with specifically-designed Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines contribute to an aircraft that delivers 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation aircraft, half the noise footprint, and decreased emissions, making it a true community-minded jetliner. Both members of the A220 Family share commonality in more than 99 percent of the line-replaceable units (LRUs), as well as the same family of engines \u2013 meaning operators can fly both versions and at a significant cost savings. Flight crews with the same pilot type rating, as well as cabin personnel, will enjoy a seamless transition between the A220-300 and A220-100, greatly reducing complexity and training costs.\n\t\tA flexible and comfortable cabin:\n\t\t\tIn addition to delivering best-in-class economics, the A220-300 has a cabin optimised for an excellent passenger experience. The aircraft\u2019s broad seats, large overhead bins that are easily accessible and upsized windows create an experience that offers passengers the comfort of a widebody aircraft in a single-aisle cabin. Like its smaller A220-100 brethren, the A220-300\u2019s configurable cabin provides two flex zones, allowing operators to benefit from fully customisable modular cabin elements called monuments, including stowage areas and partitions, based on their specific needs. Also offered is the PRM lavatory for persons with reduced mobility, which sets new standards in space utilisation and occupant privacy without the need for additional partitions or curtains. \t\nFeasibility study:\n\tBombardier appointed Gary Scott on 8 March 2004 to evaluate the creation of a New Commercial Aircraft Program.\nProgram launch:\n\tOn 31 January 2007, Bombardier announced that work on the aircraft would continue, with entry into service planned for 2013.\nSuppliers:\n\tSelected in July 2008, the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics incorporates 15 inch displays, with comprehensive navigation, communications, surveillance, engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS), and aircraft maintenance systems.\nDevelopments:\n\t(XT) version of the CS300 was also offered.\nProgram schedule:\n\tIn November 2009, first flight was expected in 2012.\nFlight testing:\n\tAn extensive update on the CSeries program was presented on 7 March 2013; the first \"flight test vehicle\" (FTV) was displayed in an almost completed state, along with three other FTVs in various states of assembly and confirming the 160-seat \"Extra Capacity\" version of the CS300, featuring two sets of over wing emergency exits.\nProgram support:\n\tIn October 2015 Airbus confirmed that it had turned down Bombardier's offer to sell a majority share of the CSeries to them. Bombardier then said it would explore alternatives. Just days before, the Government of Quebec reiterated that it would be willing to provide Bombardier with financial aid, should the company request it. Richard Aboulafia, Teal Group vice president of analysis, and a long-time critic of the CSeries, indicated that the cancellation of the program and coverage of losses by the Government of Canada were both likely.\nCertification:\n\tUS Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency certification for the CS100 was granted in June 2016.\nProduction:\n\tProduction was set to ramp from seven CSeries deliveries in 2016 to 30-35 aircraft in 2017 after Pratt & Whitney PW1000G supply and start issues are resolved.\nAirbus acquisition:\n\tOn 16 October 2017, Airbus and Bombardier Aerospace announced a partnership on the CSeries program, with Airbus acquiring a 50.01% majority stake, Bombardier keeping 31% and Investissement Qu\u00e9bec 19%, to expand in an estimated market of more than 6,000 new 100-150 seat aircraft over 20 years. Airbus's supply chain expertise should save production costs but headquarters and assembly remain in Qu\u00e9bec while U.S. customers would benefit from a second assembly line in Mobile, Alabama. This transaction was subject to regulatory approvals and was expected to be completed in 2018.\nAirbus takeover:\n\tOn 8 June, after regulatory approval, Airbus and Bombardier announced that Airbus would take a majority stake on 1 July 2018. The head office, leadership team and primary final assembly line will stay in Mirabel, with its workforce of 2,200. Bombardier will fund the cash shortfalls if required, up to US$610 million from the second half of 2018 to 2021.\nOperational history:\n\tThe CS100 (now A220-100) began revenue service on 15 July 2016 with a Swiss International Air Lines flight between Zurich and Paris.\nDesign:\n\tThe Bombardier CSeries aircraft contains a high proportion of composite materials and features larger windows. The CSeries cabin features large, rotating overhead storage bins, allowing each passenger to stow a sizeable carry-on bag overhead. Bombardier claims that compared to the cabins of current in-service narrowbody aircraft, the CSeries provides airlines with the highest overhead bin volume per passenger and a wider aisle that allows for faster boarding and disembarkation of passengers.\nVariants:\n\tAirbus A220-100\n\t\tMarketing designation of the BD-500-1A10 for aircraft from serial number 50011\n\tAirbus A220-300\n\t\tMarketing designation of the BD-500-1A11 for aircraft from serial number 55003\n\tBombardier CS100\n\t\tMarketing designation of the BD-500-1A10 for aircraft from serial number 50001 to 50010\n\tBombardier CS300\n\t\tMarketing designation of the BD-500-1A11 for aircraft for serial numbers 55001 and 55002\nMarket:\n\tThe A220-100 competes with the Embraer E195-E2, while the -300 stands against the Boeing 737 MAX 7, Airbus A319neo.\nBoeing dumping petition:\n\tOn 28 April 2016, Bombardier Aerospace sold 75 CSeries CS100 firmly plus 50 options to Delta Air Lines. On 27 April 2017, Boeing filed a petition for dumping them at $19.6m each, below their $33.2m production cost.On 9 June 2017, the US International Trade Commission (USITC) found the US industry could be threatened. On 26 September, the US Department of Commerce (DoC) observed subsidies of 220% and will collect deposits based on these. It will add a 80% preliminary anti-dumping duty on top, resulting in a total duty of 300%. The DoC announced its final ruling, a total duty of 292%, on 20 December. On 10 January 2018, the Canadian government filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization against the US.On 26 January 2018, the USITC four commissioners unanimously determined the US industry is not threatened and no duty orders will be issued, overturning the imposed duties. The Commission public report was made available by February 2018. On March 22, Boeing declined to appeal the ruling.\ncharacteristics:\n\tCockpit crew in A220-100 - 2 pilots\n\tCockpit crew in A220-300 - 2 pilots\n\tPassengers in A220-100 - 108 (8J + 100Y) to 133 (1-class)\n\tPassengers in A220-300 - 130 (12J + 118Y) to 160 (1-class)\n\tSeat pitch in A220-100 - 28\u201336 in (71\u201391 cm) in Y/J\n\tSeat pitch in A220-300 - 28\u201338 in (71\u201397 cm) in Y/J\n\tSeat width in A220-100 - 18.5 to 20 in (47 to 51 cm)\n\tSeat width in A220-300 - 18.5 to 20 in (47 to 51 cm)\n\tCargo volume in A220-100 - 838 cu ft / 23.7 m\u00b3\n\tCargo volume in A220-300 - 1,116 cu ft / 31.6 m\u00b3\n\tLength in A220-100 - 114 ft 9 in / 35.0 m\n\tLength in A220-300 - 127 ft 0 in / 38.7 m\n\tWing in A220-100 - 115 ft 1 in / 35.1 m span, 1,209 sq ft / 112.3 m\u00b2 area\n\tWing in A220-300 - 115 ft 1 in / 35.1 m span, 1,209 sq ft / 112.3 m\u00b2 area\n\tHeight in A220-100 - 37 ft 8 in / 11.5 m\n\tHeight in A220-300 - 37 ft 8 in / 11.5 m\n\tFuselage diameter in A220-100 - 12 ft 2 in / 3.7 m\n\tFuselage diameter in A220-300 - 12 ft 2 in / 3.7 m\n\tCabin in A220-100 - 129.0 in / 3.28 m width, 83.0 in / 2.11 m height\n\tCabin in A220-300 - 129.0 in / 3.28 m width, 83.0 in / 2.11 m height\n\tCabin length in A220-100 - 77 ft 10 in / 23.7 m\n\tCabin length in A220-300 - 90 ft 1 in / 27.5 m\n\tMTOW in A220-100 - 134,000 lb / 60,781 kg\n\tMTOW in A220-300 - 149,000 lb / 67,585 kg\n\tMaximum payload in A220-100 - 33,350 lb / 15,127 kg\n\tMaximum payload in A220-300 - 41,250 lb / 18,711 kg\n\tOEW in A220-100 - 77,650 lb (35,221 kg)\n\tOEW in A220-300 - 81,750 lb (37,081 kg)\n\tFuel capacity in A220-100 - 38,875 lb / 17,630 kg\n\tFuel capacity in A220-300 - 37,950 lb / 17,213 kg\n\tMaximum range in A220-100 - 3,100 nmi / 5,741 km\n\tMaximum range in A220-300 - 3,300 nmi / 6,112 km\n\tCruise speed in A220-100 - Mach .82 (470 kn; 871 km/h) maximum, Mach .78 (447 kn;829 km/h) \ttypical\n\tCruise speed in A220-300 - Mach .82 (470 kn; 871 km/h) maximum, Mach .78 (447 kn;829 km/h) \ttypical\n\tTakeoff (MTOW) in A220-100 - 4,800 ft / 1,463 m\n\tTakeoff (MTOW) in A220-300 - 6,200 ft / 1,890 m\n\tLanding (MLW) in A220-100 - 4,550 ft / 1,387 m\n\tLanding (MLW) in A220-300 - 4,950 ft / 1,509 m\n\tCeiling in A220-100 - 41,000 ft / 12,497 m\n\tCeiling in A220-300 - 41,000 ft / 12,497 m\n\tEngines in A220-100 - 2\u00d7 Pratt & Whitney PW1000G\n\tEngines in A220-300 - 2\u00d7 Pratt & Whitney PW1000G\n\tUnit thrust in A220-100 - 18,900-23,300 lbf / 84.1-103.6 kN\n\tUnit thrust in A220-300 - 21,000-23,300 lbf / 93.4-103.6 kN\n\tICAO Type in A220-100 - BCS1\n\tICAO Type in A220-300 - BCS3\n\tOverall length of A220-100 is 35 m\n\tCabin length of A220-100 is 23.7 m\n\tFuselage max diametr of A220-100 is 3.7 m\n\tMax cabin width of A220-100 is 3.28 m\n\tWingspan of A220-100 is 35.1 m\n\tHeight of A220-100 is 11.5 m\n\tTypical seating pax of A220-100 is 116\n\tMax seating pax of A220-100 is 135\n\tCargo colume in freight type of A220-100 is 20.5 m^3\n\tRange of A220-100 is 5460 km\n\tMmo if A220-100 is M0.82\n\tMax ramp weight of A220-100 is 61.24 tonnes\n\tMax take-off weight of A220-100 is 60.8 tonnes\n\tMax landing weight of A220-100 is 52.4 tonnes\n\tMax zero fuel weight of A220-100 is 50.3 tonnes\n\tMax fuel capacity of A220-100 is 21918 litres"}, {"atitle": "A300_family", "doc": "A300:\n\tGeneral:\n\t\tThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and manufactured by Airbus. Formally announced in 1969 and first flying in October 1972, it holds the distinction of being the world's first twin-engined widebody airliner; it was also the first product of Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, now known as Airbus. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum range of 4,070 nautical miles (7,540 km) when fully loaded, depending on model. Development of the A300 began during the 1960s as a European collaborative project between various aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. In September 1967, the participating nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to manufacture the aircraft. The British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. A new agreement was reached between Germany and France on 29 May 1969, and Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce the A300. The type first flew on 28 October 1972. Air France, the launch customer for the A300, introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Following a period of limited customer demand, the A300 achieved several large sales in 1978, after which the type was viewed to have proven itself and orders came in at a steady rate across the next three decades. During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with various freight operators, and several different cargo aircraft variants were produced. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller A310 derivative. The freighter sales for which the A300 had previously competed in later life are instead fulfilled by the A330-200F, a derivative of the newer Airbus A330.\n\tOrigins:\n\t\tDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, based in the UK, and Sud Aviation of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine of the Hawker Siddeley Trident and an expanded development of the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven designated the BAC Two-Eleven, it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch quite similar aircraft onto the market at the same time, none of them would achieve the volume sales needed to make them viable.\n\tProject launch:\n\t\tOn 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner.\n\tDesign:\n\t\tThe Airbus A300 is a wide-body medium-to-long range airliner; it has the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world. Upon entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane, which went on to influence later airliner designs. The technological highlights include: \n\t\t\tAdvanced wings by de Havilland (later BAE Systems) with:\n\t\t\tSupercritical airfoil section for economical performance\n\t\t\tadvanced aerodynamically efficient flight control surfaces\n\t\t\t5.64 m (222 in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 LD3 cargo containers side-by-side\n\t\t\tStructures made from metal billets, reducing weight\n\t\t\tFirst airliner to be fitted with wind shear protection\n\t\t\tAdvanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing\n\t\t\tElectrically controlled braking system\n\t\tLater A300s incorporated other advanced features such as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which enabled a two-pilot flight crew to fly the aircraft alone without the need for a flight engineer, the functions of which were automated; this two-man cockpit concept was a world-first for a wide-body aircraft.\n\tOperational history:\n\t\tOn 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for Air France.\n\tVariants:\n\t\tA300B1:\n\t\t\tOnly two were built: the first prototype, registered F-WUAB, then F-OCAZ, and a second aircraft, F-WUAC, which was leased in November 1974 to Trans European Airways (TEA) and re-registered OO-TEF. TEA instantly subleased the aircraft for six weeks to Air Alg\u00e9rie, but continued to operate the aircraft until 1990. It had accommodation for 300 passengers (TEA) or 323 passengers (Air Alg\u00e9rie) with a maximum weight of 132,000 kg and two General Electric CF6-50A engines of 220 kN thrust. The A300B1 was five frames shorter than the later production versions, being only 50.97 m (167.2 ft) in length.\n\t\tA300B2:\n\t\t\tThe first production version. Powered by General Electric CF6 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines (the same engines that powered the Boeing 747-100, \"the original jumbo jet\") of between 227 and 236 kN thrust, it entered service with Air France in May 1974. The prototype A300B2 made its first flight on 28 June 1973 and was certificated by the French and German authorities on 15 March 1974 and FAA approval followed on 30 May 1974. The first production A300B2 (A300 number 5) made its maiden flight on 15 April 1974 and was handed over to Air France a few weeks later on 10 May 1974. The A300B2 entered revenue service on 23 May 1974 between Paris and London.\n\t\t\t\tA300B2-100: 137 Metric Ton MTOW\n\t\t\t\tA300B2-200: 142 Metric Ton MTOW, with Kr\u00fcger flaps, first delivery to South African Airways in 1976\n\t\t\t\tA300B2-300: increased Maximum Landing Weight/Maximum Zero Fuel Weight\n\t\tA300B4:\n\t\t\tThe major production version features a centre fuel tank for increased fuel capacity (47,500 kg) and new wing root Kr\u00fcger flaps which were later made available as an option for the B2. Production of the B2 and B4 totalled 248. The first A300B4 (the 9th A300) flew on 25 December 1974 and was certified on 26 March 1975. The first delivery was made to Bavaria Germanair (which later merged into Hapag Lloyd) on 23 May 1975.\n\t\t\t\tA300B4-100: 157.5 Metric Ton MTOW, first delivery to Germanair in 1975.\n\t\t\t\tA300B4-200: 165 Metric Ton MTOW, first delivery to Hapag-Lloyd Flug in 1980\n\t\t\t\tA300B4-200FF: An A300 with a \"forward-facing\" crew compartment. The world's first 2-crew widebody airliner. Includes some of the A310's and A300-600's digital avionics. First saw service with Garuda Indonesia in 1982, further customers were VASP, Tunisair and Kar-Air/Finnair.\n\t\t\t\tA300B4-600: Referred to as the A300-600. See Below.\n\t\t\t\tA300C4: Convertible freighter version, with a large cargo door on the port side. First \tdelivered to South African Airways in October 1982.\n\t\t\t\tA300F4-200: Freighter version of the A300B4-200. First delivery occurred in 1986, but only \tvery few were built as the A300F4-200 was soon replaced by the more capable A300-600F (\tofficial designation: A300F4-600).\n\t\tA300-600:\n\t\t\tOfficially designated A300B4-600, this version is nearly the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and horizontal tail. It has higher power CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines and uses the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU). The A300-600 made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year with Saudi Arabian Airlines. A total of 313 A300-600s (all versions) have been sold. The A300-600 also has a similar cockpit to the A310, eliminating the need for a flight engineer. The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.\n\n\t\t\tA300-600: (Official designation: A300B4-600) The baseline model of the \u2212600 series.\n\t\t\tA300-620C: (Official designation: A300C4-620) A convertible freighter version. Four delivered between 1984 and 1985.\n\t\t\tA300-600F: (Official designation: A300F4-600) The freighter version of the baseline \u2212600.\n\t\t\tA300-600R: (Official designation: A300B4-600R) The increased range \u2212600, achieved by an additional trim fuel tank in the tail. First delivery in 1988 to American Airlines; all A300s built since 1989 (freighters included) are \u2212600Rs. Japan Air System (later merged in Japan Airlines) took delivery of the last new-built passenger A300, an A300-622R, in November 2002.\n\t\t\tA300-600RC (Official designation: A300C4-600R) The convertible freighter version of the -600R. 2 delivered in 1999.\n\t\t\tA300-600RF: (Official designation: A300F4-600R) The freighter version of the \u2212600R. All A300s delivered between November 2002 and 12 July 2007 (last ever A300 delivery) were A300-600RFs.\n\t\tA300B10 (A310):\n\t\t\tIntroduced a shorter fuselage, a new, higher aspect ratio wing, smaller horizontal tail and two crew operation. It was available in standard \u2212200 and the Extended range \u2212300 with 9,600 km (5,965 mi) range in both passenger and full cargo versions. It was also available as a military tanker/transport serving the Canadian Forces and German Air Force.

It was the second airliner to be produced by the company, the first being the A300. The A310 is a smaller derivative of the A300, which held the distinction of being the first twin-engined widebody airliner. The origin of the A310 lies within design studies originally conducted for the earlier A300 programme, specifically the smaller A300B10MC (standing for Minimum Change) design. During the flight testing stage of the A300 programme, a number of airlines approached Airbus, expressing that there was also a sizable market for a smaller aircraft, leading to the company commencing studies on producing a separate airliner to produce such an aircraft. The design settled on for the tentative airliner, later designated as the A310, was essentially a fuselage shrink of the A300, furnished with a new wing and a lighter landing gear configuration to suit the smaller scale of the aircraft. It shared a very high level of commonality with the A300, particularly in terms of the cockpit and subsystems. These similarities enabled both aircraft to be manufactured upon the same production line. On 7 July 1978, Airbus decided to launch the A300B10 programme, which it had re-designated as the A310. Initially, the company planned to produce two distinct versions of the A310, these being the regional A310-100 and the transcontinental A310-200, the latter being capable of longer-range flights. On 3 April 1982, the first prototype A310 conducted the type's maiden flight. In April 1983, the A310 entered revenue service with launch customer Swissair. From an operational perspective, the cockpit of the A310 and the A300-600 share such commonality that a dual type rating could be achieved, easing the training of flight crews for both airliners. It was produced between 1983 and 1998, having been effectively succeeded by the Airbus A320, a newer narrow-body aircraft.\n\tDevelopment:\n\t\tBackground:\n\t\t\tOn 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to commence the joint development of the 300-seat Airbus A300.\n\t\tDesign effort:\n\t\t\tFrom late 1977, prior to the Varley announcement, BAe had already commenced work on the design of the new wing at its facility in Hatfield. However, due to negotiations with Britain on its return to the Airbus consortium being protracted, alternative options were explored, including potentially manufacturing the wing elsewhere. Basic engines offered for the type included the General Electric CF6-45B2 and Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4. At one point, British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was openly considering offering an engine for the A310, the Rolls-Royce RB.207, however, it ultimately chose to discard such efforts in favour of a smaller three-spool design, the RB.211.\n\t\tProduction:\n\t\t\tThe range of the A310 exceeds that of the A300 series with the exception of the A300-600R, which in turn surpasses that of the A310-200. The greater range of the A310 contributed to the airliner being used extensively by operators on transatlantic routes. The A300 and A310 introduced the concept of commonality: A300-600 and A310 pilots can cross-qualify for the other aircraft with one day of training. The Royal Canadian Air Force currently operates a fleet of 5 Airbus CC-150 Polaris, civilian Airbus A310-300s, originally owned by Wardair, and subsequently Canadian Airlines International, after the airlines merged. The aircraft were then sold to the Canadian Government and have been converted for use as the primary long distance transport aircraft as part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's fleet of Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft.\n\t\tDesign:\n\t\t\tThe Airbus A310 was a medium- to long-range twin-engined wide-body jet airliner. It was a derivative of the A300, the aircraft having been originally initially designated as the A300B10. It was essentially a shortened variant of the earlier aircraft; however, there were considerable differences between the two aircraft.\n\t\tVariants:\n\t\t\tThe A310 is available in two basic versions, the medium range \u2212200 and the longer range \u2212300. The first version of the aircraft to be developed was the \u2212200 but this was later joined by the \u2212300 which then became the standard production version of the aircraft.\n\t\t\tA310-200:\n\t\t\t\tThe first A310, the 162nd Airbus off the production line, made its maiden flight on 3 April 1982 powered by the earlier Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4D1 engines. The \u2212200 entered service with Swissair and Lufthansa a year later. Late series \u2212200 also featured wing fences identical to those of the \u2212300. The first three A310s were initially fitted with outboard ailerons; they were later removed once testing showed them to be unnecessary.\n\t\t\tA310-200C:\n\t\t\t\tA convertible version, the seats can be removed and cargo placed on the main deck.\n\t\t\tA310-200F / -300F:\n\t\t\t\tThe freight version available as a new build or as a conversion of the existing wide-bodied aircraft. The A310-200F freighter can carry 39t of freight for 5,950 km. No production freighters of the A310 were produced. Operators such as FedEx Express acquired modified ex-passenger A310s, usually starting with the \u2212300 version.\n\t\t\tA310-300:\n\t\t\t\tFirst flown on 8 July 1985, the \u2212300 is dimensionally identical to the \u2212200, although it provides an increased Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) and an increase in range, provided by additional centre and horizontal stabilizer (trim-tank) fuel tanks. This model also introduced wingtip fences to improve aerodynamic efficiency, a feature that has since been retrofitted to some \u2212200s. The aircraft entered service in 1986 with Swissair. The A310-300 incorporates a computerised fuel distribution system which allows it to be trimmed in flight, optimising the centre of gravity by shuttling up to 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of fuel in and out of the horizontal stabilizer tank, controlled by a Center of Gravity Control Computer.\n\t\t\tA310-300C:\n\t\t\t\tA convertible passenger/cargo version, the seats can be removed and cargo placed on the main deck.\n\t\t\tA310 MRT/MRTT:\n\t\t\t\tThe A310 has been operated by several air forces as a pure transport (A310-300 MRT), however several have now been converted to the \"Multi Role Tanker Transport\" configuration by EADS, providing an aerial refueling capability. At least six have been ordered; four by the German Air Force and two by the Canadian Forces. Deliveries began in 2004. Three were converted at EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany; the other three at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg, Germany.\n\t\t\tA310 Zero G:\n\t\t\t\tOne A310 unit has been redesigned to become a scientific research laboratory dedicated to weightlessness. This reduced-gravity aircraft is used to realise parabolas allowing to perform 22 seconds of weightlessness.

The Airbus A318 Elite is aimed at the medium-range market for flights of up to 4,000-nautical-mile (7,400 km) range, with a choice of two cabin layouts seating up to 18 passengers, and powered by CFM engines. Comlux Aviation became the launch customer by ordering three A318 Elite aircraft. In September 2010, Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with Sharklets, wingtip devices which reduce lift-induced drag and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption.\n\t\tDesign:\n\t\t\tThe Airbus A318 is a small commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Overall, the A318 is over six metres shorter and around 3 t (6,600 lb) lighter than the A320. To compensate for the reduced moment arm, it has a larger vertical stabiliser.

The family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321, as well as the ACJ business jet. The A320s are also named A320ceo (current engine option) after the introduction of the A320neo (new engine option).\n\tMoving the World:\n\t\tThe A320 is one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321), representing the most successful and versatile jetliner family ever. Seating from 100 to 240 passengers and flying throughout the world \u2013 and landing on every continent \u2013 an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds. From the heat of the desert to icy Antarctic runways, or from short runway urban environments to remote high-altitude airports, the A320 can take passengers anywhere. As the longest-range single-aisle aircraft, airlines and passengers alike have benefitted from the A320\u2019s exceptional efficiency and quality since its introduction, which has opened up exciting new travel possibilities throughout the world. Now with new engine options (NEO) available, the A320 Family continues to be the preferred choice for passengers and customers; setting the standard for the single-aisle market and securing its status as the world\u2019s best-selling aircraft of all time. This is an aircraft that you can rely on. This is the aircraft that changed the game.\n\tAn Innovative Family:\n\t\tThe A320 Family is the most successful aircraft family ever and it was born ambitious. As the first civil aircraft to pioneer fly-by-wire technology, it has set the standard ever since its arrival and, thanks to significant annual investment of 300 million euros, the A320 Family continues to innovate. The A320neos boast the very latest engines, large wingtip devices (Sharklets) and an innovative cabin \u2013 continuing to go from strength-to-strength as the most comfortable, fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly single-aisle aircraft.\n\tAirspace by Airbus:\n\t\tAirbus is extending the award-winning Airspace interior to the A320 Family. A common cabin design language featuring the latest technology, Airspace offers elegantly-lit cabins, wider seats, large overhead storage bins capable of holding eight bags instead of five, iconic ceiling lighting, redesigned window bezels that provide passengers more window space with unobstructed views, new sidewall panels that provide an additional inch at shoulder level for extra personal space and a new spacious lavatory design. Passengers aboard A320 Family aircraft will be able to enjoy the distinct Airspace ambience, comfort, services and design starting in 2020. Airspace cabin interior enhancements trace their origins to the Airbus A350 XWB and A330neo widebody jetliners.\n\tDevelopment:\n\t\tOrigins:\n\t\t\tWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal. which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name \"Airbus\" at the time referred to a BEA requirement, rather than to the later international programme.\n\t\tDesign effort:\n\t\t\tIn June 1977 was set up a new Joint European Transport (JET) programme.\n\t\tNational shares:\n\t\t\tThe UK, France and West Germany wanted the responsibility of final assembly and the associated duties, known as \"work-share arguments\".\n\t\tLaunch:\n\t\t\tThe programme was launched on 2 March 1984.\n\t\tIntroduction:\n\t\t\tIn presence of then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was rolled out of the final assembly line on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes from Toulouse.\n\t\tStretching the A320: A321:\n\t\t\tThe first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.\n\t\tShrinking the A320: A319:\n\t\t\tThe A319 is the next derivative of the baseline A320. The design is a \"shrink\" with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies.\n\t\tSecond shrink: A318:\n\t\t\tThe A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317. entering service before the end of the month.\n\t\t\tTypically seating around 110 passengers, the A318 brings all the advantages of the A320 Family to a variety of possible routes suitable for a slightly smaller aircraft. With one aircraft in four sizes the A318 offers unbeatable fuel-efficiency, exceptional operational reliability and superior passenger comfort \u2013 qualities which help make the A320 Family the most successful aircraft family ever. Its enduring quality highlights the brilliance and innovation at the heart of Airbus.\n\t\t\tComfort and space:\n\t\t\t\tThe A320 leads the way in single-aisle comfort and even as the family member with the shortest fuselage, the A318 still offers the industry\u2019s best level of comfort in all classes.With the widest single-aisle cabin available, passengers can enjoy more personal space and relax in comfortable 18-inch-wide seats. The A320 also has plenty of overhead locker space so that carry-on luggage can be stored efficiently, while the wider aisle helps with boarding and disembarking. These advantages allow for minimum fuss when getting on or off, meaning less wait time at the end of a flight so that passengers can get to where they\u2019re going more quickly.\n\t\t\tCommonality where it counts:\n\t\t\t\tWhen something works brilliantly, it makes sense to use it all the time. Like all the members of the aircraft family that introduced Airbus\u2019 revolutionary fly-by-wire control system, the A318 benefits from cockpit commonality, helping to reduce the cost of training, maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Not only are pilots qualified to fly any member of the A320 Family with the Common Type Rating, but training to switch between other Airbus aircraft is even easier with Cross Crew-Qualification (CCQ). Fly-by-wire offers significant advantages from the savings delivered through the reduction in weight to the reduction in pilot workload; another example of how Airbus improves performance through innovation.\n\t\t\tUnique capabilities:\n\t\t\t\tThe A318\u2019s cabin is flexible enough to deliver a range of options, allowing it to fulfil several roles. As the largest commercial aircraft certified to land at steeper-than-usual gradients, it is ideal for operations at such constrained locations as downtown airports \u2013 translating to significant cost and time savings for business travellers. Since 2009, British Airways has been operating A318s with \u201csteep approach\u201d capability from the in-close London City Airport to New York's JFK International Airport. These aircraft are equipped for premium service with seats that convert into full lie-flat beds, along with OnAir connectivity for passengers showing that even the smallest member of the A320 Family needn\u2019t compromise on luxury and amenities. \n\t\t\tOverall length of A318 is 31.44 m\n\t\t\tCabin length of A318 is 21.38 m\n\t\t\tFuselage width of A318 is 3.95 m\n\t\t\tMax cabin width of A318 is 3.70 m\n\t\t\tWing span (geometric) of A318 is 34.10 m\n\t\t\tHeight of A318 is 12.56 m\n\t\t\tTrack of A318 is 7.59 m\n\t\t\tWheelbase of A318 is 10.25 m\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRange of A318 is 5 750 km\n\t\t\tMmo of A318 is M0.82\n\t\t\tMax ramp weight of A318 is 68.40 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax take-off weight of A318 is 68.00 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax landing weight of A318 is 57.50 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A318 is 54.50 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax fuel capacity of A318 is 24 210 litres\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTypical seating of Pax A318 is 107\n\t\t\tMax of   A318 is 132\n\t\t\tBulk hold volume of Freight A318 is 21 m\u00b3\n\t\tA320 Enhanced:\n\t\t\tImprovements:\n\t\t\t\tIn 2006, Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of improvements targeting a 4\u20135% efficiency gain with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin.\n\t\t\tSharklets:\n\t\t\t\tIn 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglet intended to counteract the wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme.\n\t\t\tCabin:\n\t\t\t\tIn 2007, Airbus introduced a new enhanced, quieter cabin with better luggage storage and a more modern look and feel, and a new galley reduces weight, increase revenue space and improves ergonomics and design for food hygiene and recycling. \n\t\t\tNew Engine Option:\n\t\t\t\tThe A320neo (neo for new engine option) is a development launched on 1 December 2010, it made its first flight on 25 September 2014 and it was introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. Re-engined with CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G engines and with large sharklets, it should be 15% more fuel efficient. Three variants are based on the previous A319, A320 and A321. Airbus received 6,031 orders by March 2018 and delivered 318 by May 2018. The original family is renamed A320ceo, for current engine option.\n\t\t\tDesign:\n\t\t\t\tThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. After the oil price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck. The end result was that the A320 consumed 50% less fuel than the 727 Its wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\n\t\t\tAirframe:\n\t\t\t\tThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156 in) outside diameter,\n\t\t\tFlight deck:\n\t\t\t\tIt includes a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's flight deck is equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft. The only analogue instruments were the Radio-magnetic indicator and brake pressure indicator. From 2003, A320's feature liquid crystal display (LCD) units in the flight deck of its A318, A319, A320, and A321 flight decks instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include the main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which was an analog display prior to this.\n\t\t\tFly-by-wire:\n\t\t\t\tThe A320 is the world's first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team which tested FBW on an A300.\n\t\t\tEngines:\n\t\t\t\tThe suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A320 series are CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney's PW6000 engines available only for the A318.\n\t\t\tProduction:\n\t\t\t\tThe Toulouse Blagnac final assembly line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder final assembly line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The Airbus factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the Airbus Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama.\n\t\t\tOperational history:\n\t\t\t\tThe Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) issued the type certificate for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market in March 1988 with Air France and Ansett Australia, Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.\n\t\t\t\tCompetition:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe A320 family was developed to compete with the 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer's E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier\n\t\t\t\tMaintenance:\n\t\t\t\t\tA Checks are every 750 flight hours and structural inspections are at six- and 12-year intervals. A320-family maintenance should grow from $20.6 billion in 2018, for three quarters on A320s and A321s, to $24.5 billion in 2022.\n\t\t\t\tReplacement airliner:\n\t\t\t\t\tAirbus was studying a future replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\".\n\t\t\tVariants:\n\t\t\t\tOverview:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the \"current engine option\" or \"CEO\" name.\n\t\t\t\tA320:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced.\n\t\t\t\t\tSingle-aisle leader:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe best keeps getting better with Airbus\u2019 market-leading single-aisle jetliners. Ensuring the A320 retains its status as the best-ever aircraft, the A320neo (new engine option) is the culmination of several technological advances delivered by Airbus\u2019 continuing commitment and investment in the most successful aircraft family of all time. Bringing all the standards of comfort and incorporating new engine choices, aerodynamic improvements, and the latest cabin features, the A320neo Family will offer up to 20 per cent savings in fuel burn per seat by 2020, two tonnes of additional payload, 500 nautical miles of more range, lower operating costs, along with a nearly 50 per cent reduction in engine noise and NOx emissions 50 per cent below the current industry standard. Also, as a result of an optimised cabin space and increased exit limits, the A320neo accommodates 165 passengers in two classes or up to 194 in a high-density configuration. Designated the NEO Family, Airbus is providing the minimum change with maximum benefit, incorporating two latest-generation engine choices \u2013 CFM International\u2019s LEAP-1A and the PurePower PW1100G-JM from Pratt & Whitney \u2013 along with the use of fuel-saving Sharklets wingtip devices. A key contributor to the NEO\u2019s performance is Sharklets \u2013 which were pioneered on the A320ceo (current engine option). These 2.4-metre-tall wingtip devices are standard on NEO aircraft, and result in up to four per cent reduced fuel burn over longer sectors, corresponding to an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of around 900 tonnes per aircraft. Sharklets also are available for new-build and retrofit on A320ceo jetliners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall length of A320neo is 37.57 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCabin length of A320neo is 27.51 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFuselage width of A320neo is 3.95 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax cabin width of A320neo is 3.70 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWing span (geometric) of A320neo is 35.80 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHeight of A320neo is 11.76 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrack of A320neo is 7.59 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWheelbase of A320neo is 12.64 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRange of A320neo is 6 300 km\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMmo of A320neo is M0.82\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax ramp weight of A320neo is 79.40 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax take-off weight of A320neo is 79.00 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax landing weight of A320neo is 67.40 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A320neo is 64.30 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax fuel capacity of A320neo is 26 730 litres\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTypical seating of Pax A320neo is 165 (2-class)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax of   A320neo is 194\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A320neo is 7 LD3-45W\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax pallet number underfloor of   A320neo is 7\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBulk hold volume of   A320neo is 37.00 m\u00b3\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A320neo is 31.70 m\u00b3\n\t\t\t\tA321:\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the A320 began operations in 1988, the A321 was launched as its first derivative.\n\t\t\t\t\tNew Engine Option:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe industry-leading quality and efficiency of Airbus\u2019 A320 Family \u2013 of which the A321 is a member \u2013 is being further enhanced with its new engine option (NEO) jetliner versions. Incorporating Airbus\u2019 \u201cSharklets\u201d and two new engine choices, the A320neo Family offers maximum benefit with minimal changes from baseline A319s, A320s and A321s \u2013 delivering per seat fuel improvements of 20 per cent, along with additional range of up to 500 nautical miles/900 km. or 2 tonnes of extra payload. For the A321neo \u2013 delivered to a customer for the first time in April 2017 \u2013 Airbus expanded seating capacity with optimised use of cabin space, increased exit limits and a new cabin door configuration. This \u201cCabin-Flex\u201d option increased the jetliner\u2019s maximum certified capacity to 244 seats, while still accommodating Airbus\u2019 modern comfort standard of at least 18-inch wide seats. The A321LR \u2013 a new variant of Airbus\u2019 A321neo, deliveries of which will begin in 2018 \u2013 will have the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner, able to fly routes of up to 4,000 nm. It is ideally suited to transatlantic routes, and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.\n\t\t\t\tA321LR: the long-range leader:\n\t\t\t\tThe A321LR \u2013 a new variant of Airbus\u2019 A321neo \u2013 will have the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner, able to fly routes of up to 4,000 nm with 206 passengers while utilising extra fuel stored in three Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs). Ideally-suited to transatlantic routes, the A321LR allows airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft. Operators can outfit it in state-of-the-art two-class configurations with full-flat seats for true long-haul comfort, or in a single-class layout. The A321LR\u2019s long-range capability was certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 2018.\n\t\t\tOverall length of A321neo is 44.51 m\n\t\t\tCabin length of A321neo is 34.44 m\n\t\t\tFuselage width of A321neo is 3.95 m\n\t\t\tMax cabin width of A321neo is 3.70 m\n\t\t\tWing span (geometric) of A321neo is 35.80 m\n\t\t\tHeight of A321neo is 11.76 m\n\t\t\tTrack of A321neo is 7.59 m\n\t\t\tWheelbase of A321neo is 16.90 m\n\t\t\tRange of A321neo is 7400 km\n\t\t\tMmo of A321neo is M0.82\n\t\t\tMax ramp weight of A321neo is 97.40 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax take-off weight of A321neo is 97.00 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax landing weight of A321neo is 79.20 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A321neo is 75.60 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax fuel capacity of A321neo is 32 940 litres\n\t\t\tTypical seating of Pax A321neo is 206 (2-class)\n\t\t\tMax of   A321neo is 244\n\t\t\tLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A321neo is 10 LD3-45W\n\t\t\tMax pallet number underfloor of   A321neo is 10\n\t\t\tBulk hold volume of   A321neo is 51.00 m\u00b3\n\t\t\tTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A321neo is 42.70 m\u00b3\n\t\t\t\tA319:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe A319 is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320.

Delivered to its first airline operator in 2016, the NEO incorporates many innovations, including latest generation engine choices \u2013 the PurePower PW1100G-JM from Pratt & Whitney and CFM International\u2019s LEAP-1A \u2013 and large Sharklet\u2122 wingtip devices, which together deliver 15 per cent in fuel savings. By 2020, the NEO will deliver a 20 per cent fuel burn improvement per seat and an additional flight distance of 500 nautical miles (950 kilometres), or the ability to carry two tonnes more payload at a given range. For the environment, the A320neo\u2019s fuel savings translate into some 5,000 tonnes fewer CO2 emitted per aircraft annually. Additionally, the A320neo provides a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions and reduced engine noise. Thanks to optimised use of cabin space, the A319neo \u2013 which performed its first flight in March 2017 \u2013 seats 140 passengers in two classes or up to 160 in a high-density layout with a range of up to 3,750 nautical miles.\n\t\t\t\t\tOverall length of A319neo is 33.84 m\n\t\t\t\t\tCabin length of A319neo is 23.78 m\n\t\t\t\t\tFuselage width of A319neo is 3.95 m\n\t\t\t\t\tMax cabin width of A319neo is 3.70 m\n\t\t\t\t\tWing span (geometric) of A319neo is 35.80 m\n\t\t\t\t\tHeight of A319neo is 11.76 m\n\t\t\t\t\tTrack of A319neo is 7.59 m\n\t\t\t\t\tWheelbase of A319neo is 11.04 m\n\t\t\t\t\tRange of A319neo is 6 850 km\n\t\t\t\t\tMmo of A319neo is M0.82\n\t\t\t\t\tMax ramp weight of A319neo is 75.90 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\tMax take-off weight of A319neo is 75.50 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\tMax landing weight of A319neo is 63.90 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A319neo is 60.30 tonnes\n\t\t\t\t\tMax fuel capacity of A319neo is 26 730 litres\n\t\t\t\t\tTypical seating of Pax A319neo is 140 (2-class)\n\t\t\t\t\tMax of   A319neo is 160\n\t\t\t\t\tLD3 capacity underfloor of Freight A319neo is 4 LD3-45W + 1 LD3/40-45W\n\t\t\t\t\tMax pallet number underfloor of   A319neo is 4\n\t\t\t\t\tBulk hold volume of   A319neo is 27.00 m\u00b3\n\t\t\t\t\tTotal volume (Bulk loading) of   A319neo is 24.20 m\u00b3\n\t\t\t\tA319CJ:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe A319CJ (rebranded ACJ319) is the corporate jet version of the A319.

Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\n\t\t\t\tA318:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,100 nmi (5,700 km; 3,600 mi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City Airport. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed as of 31 October 2015.\n\t\t\t\tFreighter:\n\t\t\t\t\tA programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap's passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.\n\t\t\t\tOperators:\n\t\t\t\t\tAs of 31 December 2017, 7,630 Airbus A320-family aircraft (all variants, including the A320neo family) remained in commercial service with over 330 airline operators.

It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. The aircraft would be a minimum-changed derivative of the A320, apart from a number of minor modifications to the wing, and the fuselage stretch itself. To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included and minor trailing edge modifications were implemented, Wingspan remained unchanged, supplementing various wingtip devices. Two suppliers provided turbofan engines for the A321: CFM International with its CFM56 and International Aero Engines with the V2500 engine, both in the thrust range of 133\u2013147 kN (30,000\u201333,000 lbf).\n\tVariants:\n\t\tA321-100:\n\t\t\tThe original derivative of the A321, the A321-100, featured a reduction in range compared to the A320 as extra fuel tankage was not added to the initial design to compensate for the extra weight. The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of the A321-100 was increased to 83,000 kg (183,000 lb). The A321-100 entered service with Lufthansa in 1994. Only about 90 were ever produced.\n\t\tA321-200:\n\t\t\tAirbus launched the heavier and longer range A321-200 development in 1995 which has a full-passenger transcontinental US range. This is achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional 2,990 L (790 US gal) tanks in the rear underfloor hold. The additional fuel tankage increases the total capacity of this model to 30,030 L (7,930 US gal). These modifications also increased the maximum takeoff weight of the A321-200 to 93,000 kg (205,000 lb). This variant first flew in December 1996, and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997. Its direct competitors include the 757\u2013200 and the 737-900/900ER.\n\t\tA321neo:\n\t\t\tThe A321neo will be part of the Airbus A320neo family of airliners developed since December 2010 by Airbus,\n\t\tA321LR:\n\t\t\tThe A321LR is a longer range variant of the A321neo, which Airbus predicts provides an overall 25\u201330% lower operating cost than the Boeing 757 on routes of up to 4,100 nmi (7,600 km; 4,700 mi) where a wide-body would be uneconomical.

The A340 was assembled in Toulouse, France. It seats up to 375 passengers in the standard variants and 440 in the stretched -600 series. Depending on the model, it has a range of 6,700 to 9,000 nautical miles (12,400 to 16,700 km; 7,700 to 10,400 mi). Its distinguishing features are four high-bypass turbofan engines and three-bogie main landing gear. The A340 was manufactured in four fuselage lengths. The initial variant, A340-300, which entered service in 1993, measured 63.69 metres (209.0 ft).\n\tDevelopment:\n\t\tBackground:\n\t\t\tWhen Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.\n\t\tDesign effort:\n\t\t\tThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982. \n\t\tProduction and testing:\n\t\t\tIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. Filton was the site of BAE's \u00a37 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor area.\n\t\tEntry into service and demonstration:\n\t\t\tThe first A340, a -200, was delivered to Lufthansa on 2 February 1993 and entered service on 15 March.\n\t\t-500/600 larger variants:\n\t\t\tIn 1991, the A340-400X was a simple 12-frame, 20 ft 10 in (6.35 m) -300 stretch from 295 to 335 passengers with the MTOW bumped from 553,360 to 588,600 lb (251 to 267 t) and the range decreased by 750 to 5,900 nmi (1,390 to 10,930 km).\n\t\tEnd of production:\n\t\t\tIn 2005, 155 B777s were ordered against 15 A340s: twin engine ETOPS restrictions were overcome by lower operating costs, compared to quad jets.\n\t\tDesign:\n\t\t\tThe Airbus A340 is a wide-body twin-aisle passenger airliner which has the distinction of being the first truly long-range aircraft to be produced by Airbus.\n\t\tOperational history:\n\t\t\tThe first variant of the A340 to be introduced, the A340-200, entered service with the launch customer, Lufthansa, in 1993. It was followed shortly thereafter by the A340-300 with its operator, Air France. Lufthansa's first A340, which had been dubbed N\u00fcrnberg (D-AIBA),\n\t\tVariants:\n\t\t\tThere are four variants of the A340. The A340-200 and A340-300 were launched in 1987 with introduction into service in March 1993 for the -200. The A340-500 and A340-600 were launched in 1997 with introduction into service in 2002. All variants were available in a corporate version.\n\t\tA340-200:\n\t\t\tThe -200 is one of two initial versions of the A340; it has seating for 261 passengers in a three-class cabin layout with a range of 13,800 kilometres (7,500 nmi) or seating for 240 passengers also in a three-class cabin layout for a range of 15,000 kilometres (8,100 nmi). All active remaining A340-200s still flying after July 2017 are VIP or government planes.\n\t\tA340-300:\n\t\t\tThe A340-300 flies 295 passengers in a typical three-class cabin layout over 6,700 nautical miles (12,400 km). This is the initial version, having flown on 25 October 1991, and entered service with Lufthansa and Air France in March 1993. It is powered by four CFMI CFM56-5C engines and uses the Honeywell 331\u2013350\n\t\tA340-500:\n\t\t\tWhen the A340-500 was introduced, it was the world's longest-range commercial airliner. It first flew on 11 February 2002, and was certified on 3 December 2002. Air Canada was supposed to be the launch customer, but filed for bankruptcy in January 2003, delaying delivery to March. This allowed early deliveries to the new launch customer, Emirates, allowing the carrier to launch nonstop service from Dubai to New York\u2014its first route in the Americas. The A340-500 can fly 313 passengers in a three-class cabin layout over 16020 km (8650 nm). Compared with the A340-300, the -500 features a 4.3-metre (14.1 ft) fuselage stretch, an enlarged wing, significant increase in fuel capacity (around 50% over the -300), slightly higher cruising speed, a larger horizontal stabilizer and a larger vertical tailplane. The centerline main landing gear was changed to a four-wheel bogie to support additional weight. The A340-500 is powered by four 240 kN (54,000 lbf) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 553 turbofans and uses the Honeywell 331\u2013600\n\t\tA340-600:\n\t\t\tDesigned to replace early-generation Boeing 747 airliners, the A340-600 is capable of carrying 379 passengers in a three-class cabin layout 13,900 km (7,500 nmi). It provides similar passenger capacity to a 747 but with 25 percent more cargo volume, and at lower trip and seat costs.

The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre reinforced polymer. The prototype A350 first flew on 14 June 2013 from Toulouse, France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency was received in September 2014 and certification from the Federal Aviation Administration two months later. On 15 January 2015, the A350-900 entered service with its launch operator Qatar Airways, and the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same airline.\n\tA natural revolution in design:\n\t\tThe most perfect designs often are found in nature. That\u2019s why Airbus looks to learn from the natural world when designing and improving upon its aircraft. As the newest member of the company\u2019s widebody family, the A350 XWB is an example of how this inspirational blend of science and nature represents another significant evolution in the ongoing mission to conceive and manufacture the perfect aircraft. The A350 XWB has learned from nature to help ensure a healthy future for the planet, whether it\u2019s the revolutionary adaptive wing design \u2013 inspired by birds \u2013 which morphs while airborne to achieve maximum aerodynamic efficiency by optimising wing loading, reducing drag and lowering fuel burn; or the savings generated by innovative technological advances. Designed with passengers and airlines at heart, the A350 XWB benefits from being built with over 70 per cent advanced materials; combining carbon composites (53 per cent), titanium and modern aluminium alloys, to create a lighter and more cost-efficient aircraft while also reducing maintenance requirements. The latest generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines are quieter and more efficient. The combination of these advantages result in 25 per cent lower operating costs, fuel burn and C02 emissions when compared with previous-generation aircraft \u2013 showing Airbus\u2019 commitment to protecting the environment while remaining at the cutting edge of air travel. \n\tAirspace: a new standard of comfort:\n\t\tIt\u2019s not only the technology that has been transformed. When Airbus designed the A350 XWB, a cabin was created that is so comfortable it revolutionised the approach to all of the company\u2019s aircraft interiors. As the founding member of the Airspace by Airbus cabin family, passengers on the A350 XWB can experience a feeling of on-board comfort like never before. The aircraft\u2019s innovative design delivers a feeling of spaciousness wherever you look, with wider seats, high ceilings and alluring ambient lighting. Airbus has produced the perfect environment in which to enjoy flying to any long-haul destination. The A350 XWB\u2019s cabin also is the quietest on a twin-aisle aircraft, and its advanced technology delivers the highest possible air quality with optimised cabin altitude (6000 ft), temperature and humidity, with the air being renewed every two-to-three minutes. Passengers can relax knowing that Airbus has thought of everything to ensure that they can arrive feeling fresh. Long journeys pass quickly with the latest-generation in-flight experience. Integrated connectivity lets passengers stay in touch with the rest of the world, while smart galleys and comfortable crew rest areas provide cabin crew with a pleasant working environment that makes it even easier to look after passengers.\n\tThe smart choice for any airline:\n\t\tIt\u2019s no surprise that this brilliantly-designed aircraft is one of the most versatile in the sky. The A350 XWB actually offers true long-range capability of up to 8,100 nautical miles, but can also be easily configured to operate both regional and ultra-long haul routes (up to 9,700nm), demonstrating its full operational flexibility. The A350 XWB also perfectly complements the A330 Family, offering significant advantages to airlines operating both aircraft. Whether it is in terms of route planning or the reduced training time for pilots familiar with A330 (thanks to the common type rating), a seamless integration of the two families is highly economical and proves the value of the A350 XWB\u2019s innovative design.\n\tA350-900:\n\t\tGoing the \u2018Xtra\u2019 distance:\n\t\t\tAirbus launched the Ultra Long Range version of its A350-900 as part of the company\u2019s philosophy of continuous innovation. Designated the A350-900ULR, this jetliner can fly further than any other aircraft in commercial service \u2013 up to 9,700 nautical miles. Benefitting from the A350-900\u2019s unique flexibility, the extended range capability does not involve installation of additional fuel tanks, but rather an adaptation of the fuel system within the existing fuel tank. In addition, the A350-900ULR can be reconfigured to the standard long-haul specifications of the A350-900 if required by the operator. With a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 280 tonnes, the A350-900ULR is capable of flying over 20 hours non-stop, combining the highest levels of passenger and crew comfort with unbeatable economics for such distances.\n\t\tState-of-the-art travel:\n\t\t\tLike all members of the A350 XWB Family, the A350-900 benefits from having the most modern cabin \u2013 delivering new standards of comfort to passengers throughout the flight. The advances made in the A350 XWB\u2019s cabin have led to development of the Airspace by Airbus concept, which delivers the perfect space for passenger well-being \u2013 exemplified by the A350 XWB \u2013 to the rest of Airbus\u2019 aircraft families. Passengers on the A350-900 can look forward to a spacious, elegantly-lit cabin as they settle into Airbus\u2019 wider seats for an enjoyable flight. The quietness of the cabin contributes to a relaxing environment, while the latest in-flight entertainment allows passengers to access movies on demand or stay-up-to-date with the world below thanks to Wi-Fi and mobile phone connectivity \u2013 whether it\u2019s for social media, replying to important business emails or something else.\n\t\tImpactful innovation:\n\t\t\tIncorporating advances in flight controls, systems and wing design, the A350-900 is a truly state-of-the-art aircraft. These developments have a genuine impact in terms of safety, maintenance and efficiency, meaning that the aircraft reduces its fuel burn significantly \u2013 generating savings and reducing its environmental impact. As with all A350 XWB models, the fuselage is built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) \u2013 which supports lower fuel burn, easier maintenance and increased resistance to corrosion. The jetliner\u2019s wings also are more efficient and quieter due to their advanced design, which allows them to adapt while airborne \u2013 tailoring it for maximum aerodynamic efficiency in the various phases of flight.\n\t\tDimensions:\n\t\t\tOverall length of A350-900 is 66.8 m\n\t\t\tCabin length of A350-900 is 51.04 m\n\t\t\tFuselage max diametr of A350-900 is 5.96 m\n\t\t\tMax cabin width of A350-900 is 5.61 m\n\t\t\tWingspan of A350-900 is 64.75 m\n\t\t\tHeight of A350-900 is 17.05 m\n\t\t\tTrack of A350-900 is 10.6 m\n\t\t\tWheelbase of A350-900 is 28.66 m\n\t\tCapacity:\n\t\t\tTypical seating pax of A350-900 is 325\n\t\t\tMax seating pax of A350-900 is 440\n\t\t\tLD3 capacity underfloor in freight type of A350-900 is 36\n\t\t\tMax pallet number underfloor in freight type of A350-900 is 11\n\t\t\tBulk hold volume in freight type of A350-900 is 11.3 m^3\n\t\t\tTotal volume(Bulk loading) in freight type of A350-900 is 172.4 m^3\n\t\tPerfomance\n\t\t\tRange of A350-900 is 15000 km\n\t\t\tMmo if A350-900 is M0.89\n\t\t\tMax ramp weight of A350-900 is 280.90 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax take-off weight of A350-900 is 280.00 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax landing weight of A350-900 is 207.00 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A350-900 is 195.70 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax fuel capacity of A350-900 is 141000 litres\n\tA350-1000:\n\t\tHigh performance:\n\t\t\tDesigned with airlines' priorities in mind, the A350 XWB meets the multiple challenges of high fuel prices, rising expectations from passengers and increasing environmental concerns. As with the other A350 XWB Family members, Airbus\u2019 A350-1000 brings together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies for a 25 percent step change in fuel efficiency compared to its current long-range competitor. Seven metres longer than the A350-900; the A350-1000 features modified wing trailing-edges, larger six-wheel main landing gears, an advanced airframe with extensive use of composite materials, and the world\u2019s most efficient large aero-engine.\n\t\tAirspace by Airbus:\n\t\t\tThe A350 XWB Family cabin design proved to be so successful that it redefined Airbus\u2019 approach to cabin interiors \u2013 leading to the creation of Airspace by Airbus, a next-generation cabin concept inspired by four key attributes: comfort, service, ambience and design. The A350-1000 offers passengers the quietest twin-aisle cabin in the skies, wider seats and elegant LED ambient lighting that not only contributes to a beautiful interior, but minimises the effects of jetlag, as well. The A350-1000 also can offer passengers the most modern in-flight experience available. With movies on-demand included within a range of features, passengers can stay entertained throughout their flight, while the availability of Wi-Fi connectivity can ensure that they can stay in touch with the world below; whether it\u2019s posting to social networks, staying on top of important business emails or something else, there\u2019s no need to be out of touch when you\u2019re in the air.\n\t\tInnovation: \n\t\t\tThe A350 XWB is truly innovative, with new technology throughout the entirety of the aircraft. From the design of the wings that morph and change shape in flight to obtain optimal efficiency to the flight controls and system that reduce the pilot\u2019s workload, this aircraft utilizes modern technology to create a better way of flying. Nowhere is this innovation more apparent than in the A350 XWB\u2019s fuselage, built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic. The combination of these technological advances ensures that the A350-1000 burns 25 percent less fuel than its nearest competitor, saving money and reducing harmful effects to the environment.\n\t\tIncreased efficiency\n\t\t\tPowering the A350-1000 are Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines that allow the largest member of the A350 XWB Family to attain high levels of efficiency. Each engine provides 97,000 lbs. of thrust on takeoff \u2013 the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft \u2013 providing additional payload capability and range. With these specially-tailored Trent XWB powerplants, the A350-1000 is capable of long-haul routes to emerging markets such as Shanghai-Boston or Paris-Santiago, as well as more traditional flight segments as Manchester-Los Angeles or Dubai-Melbourne.\n\t\tDimensions:\n\t\t\tOverall length of A350-1000 is 73.79 m\n\t\t\tCabin length of A350-1000 is 58.03 m\n\t\t\tFuselage max diametr of A350-1000 is 5.96 m\n\t\t\tMax cabin width of A350-1000 is 5.61 m\n\t\t\tWingspan of A350-1000 is 64.74 m\n\t\t\tHeight of A350-1000 is 17.08 m\n\t\t\tTrack of A350-1000 is 10.73 m \n\t\t\tWheelbase of A350-1000 is 32.48 m\n\t\tCapacity:\n\t\t\tTypical seating pax of A350-1000 is 366\n\t\t\tMax seating pax of A350-1000 is 440\n\t\t\tMax pallet number underfloor in freight type of A350-1000 is 14\n\t\t\tBulk hold volume in freight type of A350-1000 is 11.30 m^3\n\t\t\tTotal volume in freoght type of A350-1000 is 208.20 m^3\n\t\tPerfomance\n\t\t\tRange of A350-1000 is 15557 km\n\t\t\tMmo if A350-1000 is M0.89\n\t\t\tMax ramp weight of A350-1000 is 316.90 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax take-off weight of A350-1000 is 316 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax landing weight of A350-1000 is 236 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A350-1000 is 223 tonnes\n\t\t\tMax fuel capacity of A350-1000 is 159000 litres\n\tEarly designs:\n\t\tAirbus initially rejected Boeing's claim that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be a serious threat to the Airbus A330, stating that the 787 was just a reaction to the A330 and that no response was needed. When airlines urged Airbus to provide a competitor, Airbus initially proposed the \"A330-200Lite\", a derivative of the A330 featuring improved aerodynamics and engines similar to those on the 787.\n\tRedesign and launch:\n\t\tOn 14 July 2006, during the Farnborough Airshow, the redesigned aircraft was designated \"A350 XWB\" (Xtra-Wide-Body).\n\tDesign phase:\n\t\tAirbus suggested Boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs,\n\tProduction:\n\t\tIn 2008, Airbus planned to introduce new techniques and procedures to cut assembly time in half.\n\tTesting and certification:\n\t\tThe first Trent engine test was made on 14 June 2010.\n\tIntroduction and early operations:\n\t\tIn June 2011, the A350-900 was scheduled to enter service in the first half of 2014, with the -800 to enter service in mid-2016, and the -1000 in 2017.\n\tDesign:\n\t\tOverview:\n\t\t\tIn September 2007, Airbus rolled out new design advances to a gathering of 100 representatives from existing and potential XWB customers. The A350 XWB is based on the technologies developed for the Airbus A380 and includes a similar cockpit and fly-by-wire systems layout. Airbus expects 10 percent lower airframe maintenance compared with the original A350 design and 14 percent lower empty seat weight than the Boeing 777.\n\t\tMaterials:\n\t\t\tThe A350 XWB airframe will be made out of 53 percent composites: carbon fibre reinforced plastic for the outer and centre wing box (covers, stringers, spars), fuselage (skin, frame, keel beam, and rear fuselage) and the empennage (horizontal and vertical tailplanes); 19 percent aluminium and aluminium-lithium alloy for ribs, floor beams, and gear bays; 14 percent titanium for landing gears, pylons, and attachments; 6 percent steel; and 8 percent miscellaneous.\n\t\tFuselage:\n\t\t\tThe A350 XWB fuselage has a constant width from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous Airbus aircraft, to provide maximum usable volume.\n\t\tUndercarriage:\n\t\t\tAirbus adopted a new philosophy for the attachment of the A350's main undercarriage as part of the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.\n\t\tWing:\n\t\t\tThe A350 features new composite wings with a wingspan that is common to the proposed variants.\n\t\tCockpit and avionics:\n\t\t\tThe revised design of the A350 XWB's glass cockpit dropped the A380-sized display and adopted 38 cm (15 in) liquid-crystal display screens. The new six-screen configuration includes two central displays mounted one above the other (the lower one above the thrust levers) and a single (for each pilot) primary flight/navigation display, with an adjacent on-board information system screen. Airbus stated that the benefits includes reduced maintenance and lower weight because as the IMA replaces multiple processors and LRUs with around 50 percent fewer standard computer modules known as line-replaceable modules. The IMA runs on a 100 Mbit/s network based on the AFDX standard, as employed in the A380, in place of the architecture used on the A330/A340.\n\t\tPropulsion:\n\t\t\tThe Rolls-Royce Trent XWB feature a 118 in (300 cm) fan disk diameter and the design will be based on the advanced developments of the Airbus A380 Trent 900 and the Boeing 787 Trent 1000. It has two thrust levels to power the A350 variants: a 84,000 lbf (370 kN) for the A350-900 and a 97,000 lbf (430 kN) for the A350-1000. The higher-thrust version will have some modifications to the fan module\u2014it will be the same diameter but will run slightly faster and have a new fan blade design\u2014and run at increased temperatures allowed by new materials technologies from Rolls-Royce's research. Engine thrust-reversers and nacelles will be supplied by US-based UTC Aerospace Systems.\n\t\tSystems:\n\t\t\tHoneywell supplies its 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) HGT1700 auxiliary power unit with 10 percent greater power density than the TPE331 from which it is developed, and the air management system: the bleed air, environmental control, cabin pressure control and supplemental cooling systems.\n\t\tVariants:\n\t\t\tThe three main variants of the A350 were launched in 2006, with entry into service planned for 2013.\n\t\t\tA350-900:\n\t\t\t\tThe A350-900 is the first A350 model, has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 280 tonnes, typically seats 325 passengers, and has a range of 8,100 nmi (15,001 km).\n\t\t\tA350-900ULR:\n\t\t\t\tThe MTOW of the ultra-long range -900ULR is being increased to 280 t (620,000 lb) and its fuel capacity from 141,000 to 165,000 l (37,000 to 44,000 US gal) within existing fuel tanks, enabling up to 19-hour flights with a 9,700 nmi (18,000 km) range.\n\t\t\tACJ350:\n\t\t\t\tAirbus Corporate Jet version of the A350, the ACJ350, is derived from the A350-900ULR. As a result of the increased fuel capacity from the -900ULR, the ACJ350 has a maximum range of 20,000 km (10,800 nmi).\n\t\t\tA350 Regional:\n\t\t\t\tAfter the Boeing 787-10 launch at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Airbus discussed with airlines a possible A350-900 Regional with a reduced MTOW of 250 tonnes and engine thrust reduced to 70,000-75,000 lb (from the standard 85,000 lb). Since 2013, there has been no further announcement about this variant.\n\t\t\tA350-1000:\n\t\t\t\tThe A350-1000 is the largest variant of the A350 family at just under 74 metres in length. It seats 366 passengers in a typical three-class layout with a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km).\n\t\t\tFurther stretch:\n\t\t\t\tAirbus has explored the possibility of a further stretch offering 45 more seats.\n\t\t\tUndeveloped A350-800:\n\t\t\t\tThe 60.45 m (198.3 ft) long A350-800 was designed to seat 276 passengers in a typical 3-class configuration with a range of 15,270 km (8,245 nmi) with an MTOW of 259 t (571,000 lb).\n\t\tCockpit crew in A350-900 - Two\n\t\tCockpit crew in A350-1000 - Two\n\t\tSeating in A350-900 - 325/315 (48B+267Y)ULR: 173=80J+93Y\n\t\tSeating in A350-1000 - 366/369 (54B+315Y)387 (2-class)\n\t\tExit limit in A350-900 - 440\n\t\tExit limit in A350-1000 - 440\n\t\tOverall length in A350-900 - 66.8 m / 219.5 ft\n\t\tOverall length in A350-1000 - 73.78 m / 242.7 ft\n\t\tWing in A350-900 - 64.75 m / 212.43 ft span, 31.9\u00b0 sweep\n\t\tWing in A350-1000 - 64.75 m / 212.43 ft span, 31.9\u00b0 sweep\n\t\tAspect ratio in A350-900 - 9.49\n\t\tAspect ratio in A350-1000 - 9.03\n\t\tWing area in A350-900 - 442 m2 (4,760 sq ft)\n\t\tWing area in A350-1000 - 464.3 m2 (4,998 sq ft)\n\t\tOverall height in A350-900 - 17.05 m / 55 ft 11 in\n\t\tOverall height in A350-1000 - 17.08 m / 56 ft 0 in\n\t\tFuselage in A350-900 - 5.96 m / 19.7 ft width, 6.09 m / 19.98 ft height\n\t\tFuselage in A350-1000 - 5.96 m / 19.7 ft width, 6.09 m / 19.98 ft height\n\t\tCabin width in A350-900 - 5.61 m / 18 ft 5 in,\n\t\tCabin width in A350-1000 - 5.61 m / 18 ft 5 in,\n\t\tMTOW in A350-900 - 280 t / 617,295 lb\n\t\tMTOW in A350-1000 - 316 t / 696,661 lb\n\t\tMax. payload in A350-900 - 53.3 t (118,000 lb)\n\t\tMax. payload in A350-1000 - 64.2 t (142,000 lb)\n\t\tFuel capacity in A350-900 - 140,795 L (37,194 US gal)110,523 kg (243,662 lb)\n\t\tFuel capacity in A350-1000 - 158,791 L (41,948 US gal)124,651 kg (274,808 lb)\n\t\tOEW in A350-900 - 142.4 t (314,000 lb) typical134.7\u2013145.1 t (297,000\u2013320,000 lb)\n\t\tOEW in A350-1000 - 158.8 t (350,000 lb)155 t (342,000 lb) dry\n\t\tMEW in A350-900 - 115.7 t (255,075 lb)\n\t\tMEW in A350-1000 - 129 t (284,000 lb)\n\t\tCargo capacity in A350-900 - 36 LD3 or 11 pallets\n\t\tCargo capacity in A350-1000 - 44 LD3 or 14 pallets\n\t\tcruise in A350-900 - Mach 0.85 (488 kn; 903 km/h) Typical, Mach 0.89 (513 kn; 950 km/h) Maximum\n\t\tcruise in A350-1000 - Mach 0.85 (488 kn; 903 km/h) Typical, Mach 0.89 (513 kn; 950 km/h) Maximum\n\t\tRange in A350-900 - 15,000 km / 8,100 nmi\n\t\tRange in A350-1000 - 15,600 km (8,400 nmi)\n\t\tTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A350-900 - 2,600 m (8,500 ft)\n\t\tTakeoff (MTOW, SL, ISA) in A350-1000 - \n\t\tLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A350-900 - 2,000 m (6,600 ft)\n\t\tLanding (MLW, SL, ISA) in A350-1000 - \n\t\tService ceiling in A350-900 - 43,100 ft (13,100 m)\n\t\tService ceiling in A350-1000 - 41,450 ft (12,630 m)\n\t\tEngines (2\u00d7) in A350-900 - Rolls-Royce Trent XWB\n\t\tEngines (2\u00d7) in A350-1000 - Rolls-Royce Trent XWB\n\t\tMaximum thrust in A350-900 - 374.5 kN / 84,200 lbf\n\t\tMaximum thrust in A350-1000 - 431.5 kN / 97,000 lbf\t\t"}, {"atitle": "A380", "doc": "A380:\n\tThe Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by Airbus.\n\tRevenue generation:\n\t\tThe A380\u2019s service introduction ushered in a new era of airline transportation for operators. Whether it\u2019s being used to reduce the number of flights and create cost savings while maintaining capacity, or to offer more capacity with fewer takeoff slots, the A380 brings operators a wide range of commercial advantages. Furthermore, with two full-length decks, more space for every passenger, and a flying experience no other aircraft in the sky can match, the A380 has become a must-have ticket on every route it flies \u2013 resulting in a significant first-mover advantage for operators.\n\tNew technologies:\n\t\tThe A380\u2019s cockpit \u2013 which is based on Airbus\u2019 industry-leading flight deck design for its fly-by-wire jetliner families \u2013 features the latest advances in cockpit technology, including larger interactive displays, an advanced flight management system and improved navigation modes. The A380's main instrument panel incorporates eight identical and interchangeable Liquid Crystal Display Units, providing a primary flight display, navigation display, two multi-function displays, an engine warning display and a systems display. The increased display size provides increased perspective for pilots and allows for enhanced presentation modes as a vertical situation awareness function that presents a \u201cvertical cut\u201d of the aircraft trajectory incorporating flight path, terrain and weather information. A key A380 innovation is the use of an electronic library to largely replace the traditional paper documentation used by pilots. This library allows flight and maintenance crews to easily locate relevant operational information in the various flight manuals, lists and logbooks, while enabling an optimisation of performance and weight-and-balance computations.\n\tRunway management:\n\t\tAirbus introduced its innovative Brake to Vacate technology on the A380, allowing flight crews to more effectively manage approach and landing by pre-selecting the optimum runway exit. This can reduce runway occupancy time by up to 30 per cent \u2013 significantly increasing the number of aircraft that can be handled by the world\u2019s airports.\n\tAdvanced materials:\n\t\tBy incorporating the latest advances in structures and materials, the A380 offers the lowest cost per seat of any widebody aircraft, over 15 per cent lower than its nearest competitor. This includes the use of advanced aluminium alloys for the wing and fuselage, along with the extensive application of composite materials in the centre wing box\u2019s primary structure, wing ribs, and rear fuselage section. The A380 also uses Glare\u2122 material in the pressurised fuselage\u2019s upper and lateral shells. Glare\u2122 is a laminate incorporating alternate layers of aluminium alloy and glass fibre reinforced adhesive, with its properties optimised by adjusting the number of plies and orientation of the glass tapes. This offers a significant reduction in weight and provides advanced fatigue and damage resistance characteristics.\n\tEfficiency and reliability: \n\t\tTwo new-generation engine options (the Engine Alliance GP7200 and Rolls-Royce Trent 900), combined with an advanced wing and landing gear design, make the A380 significantly quieter than today's largest airliner \u2013 enabling this very large aircraft to meet strict local regulations at airports around the world. With a new wing design and composite materials accounting for 25 per cent of its structural weight, the A380 is the most efficient aircraft all around. By producing only about 75 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometre, the A380 is helping the aviation industry's commitment to minimise greenhouse gas emissions. A380 reliability and maintainability is further increased with modern technology, including an enhanced onboard central maintenance system and variable frequency generators \u2013 which simplify the large aircraft\u2019s electrical generation network. Hydraulic power is provided by two fully independent systems with an operating pressure of 5,000 psi., instead of the conventional 3,000 psi. This capacity for higher pressure results in smaller and lighter hydraulic system equipment, as well as less hydraulic fluid on board, proving how Airbus innovations continue to deliver efficiency in every area of aircraft design and manufacture.\n\tDimensions:\n\t\tOverall length of A380 is 72.72 m\n\t\tCabin length of A380 is 49.90 m\n\t\tFuselage max diametr of A380 is 7.14 m\n\t\tMax cabin width of A380 is 6.54 m\n\t\tWingspan of A380 is 79.75 m\n\t\tHeight of A380 is 24.09 m\n\t\tTrack if A380 is 14.34 m\n\t\tWheelbase of A380 is 31.88 m\n\tCapacity:\n\t\tTypical seating pax of A380 is 575\n\t\tMax seating pax of A380 is 853\n\t\tLD3 capacity number underfloor in freight type of A380 is 13\n\t\tBulk hold volume in freight type of A380 is 14.30 m^3 \n\t\tTotal volume in freight type of A380 is 184.20 m^3\n\tPerfomance\n\t\tRange of A380 is 14800 km\n\t\tMmo if A380 is M0.89\n\t\tMax ramp weight of A380 is 577 tonnes\n\t\tMax take-off weight of A380 is 575 tonnes\n\t\tMax landing weight of A380 is 394 tonnes\n\t\tMax zero fuel weight of A380 is 369 tonnes\n\t\tMax fuel capacity of A380 is 320000 litres\n\tBackground:\n\t\tIn mid-1988, Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began work in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747. billion when the first aircraft was completed.\n\tTotal development cost:\n\t\tIn 2000, the originally projected development cost was \u20ac9.5 billion.\n\tProduction:\n\t\tMajor structural sections of the A380 are built in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Due to the sections' large size, traditional transportation methods proved unfeasible,\n\tTesting:\n\t\tFive A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes.\n\tProduction and delivery delays:\n\t\tInitial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530 km (330 mi) of wiring in each aircraft. Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of configuration management and change control.\n\tProduction rate:\n\t\tAt the July 2016 Farnborough Airshow Airbus announced that in a \u201cprudent, proactive step,\u201d starting in 2018 it expects to deliver 12 A380 aircraft per year, down from 27 deliveries in 2015. The firm also warned production might slip back into red ink on each aircraft produced at that time, though it anticipates production will remain in the black for 2016 and 2017. \u201cThe company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further.\u201d\n\tEntry into service:\n\t\tNicknamed Superjumbo,\n\tImprovements and upgrades:\n\t\tIn 2010, Airbus announced a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1.5\u00b0 increase in wing twist. Airbus will also offer, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by 4 t (8,800 lb), to 573 t (1,263,000 lb) and the range is extended by 100 nautical miles (190 km); this is achieved by reducing flight loads, partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws.\n\tPost-delivery problems:\n\t\tDuring repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident, cracks were discovered in wing fittings. As a result, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 which affected 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1,300 flights.\n\tDesign:\n\t\tOverview:\n\t\t\tThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the A380-800 and the A380F. The A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration\n\t\tEngines:\n\t\t\tThe A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines.\n\t\tWings:\n\t\t\tThe A380's wing is sized for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over 650 tonnes to accommodate these future versions, albeit with some internal strengthening required on the A380F freighter.\n\t\tMaterials:\n\t\t\tWhile most of the fuselage is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380's airframe.\n\t\tAvionics:\n\t\t\tThe A380 employs an integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture, first used in advanced military aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,\n\t\tSystems:\n\t\t\tPower-by-wire flight control actuators have been used for the first time in civil aviation to back up primary hydraulic actuators. Also, during certain manoeuvres they augment the primary actuators.\n\t\tPassenger provisions:\n\t\t\tThe cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 1,520 m (5,000 ft) up to 12,000 m (39,000 ft).\n\tIntegration with infrastructure and regulations:\n\t\tGround operations:\n\t\t\tIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the \"80-metre box\" was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m (260 ft) wingspan and length to be accommodated.\n\t\tTakeoff and landing separation:\n\t\t\tIn 2005, the ICAO recommended that provisional separation criteria for the A380 on takeoff\n\t\tMaintenance:\n\t\t\tAs the A380 fleet grows older, airworthiness authority rules require certain scheduled inspections from approved aircraft tool shops. The increasing fleet size (to about 286 in 2020) cause expected maintenance and modification to cost $6.8 billion for 2015\u20132020, of which $2.1 billion are for engines. Emirates performed its first 3C-check for 55 days in 2014. During lengthy shop stays, some airlines will use the opportunity to install new interiors.\n\tVariants:\n\t\tA380F:\n\t\t\tAirbus originally accepted orders for the freighter variant, offering the largest payload capacity of any cargo aircraft in production, exceeded only by the single Antonov An-225 Mriya in service.\n\t\tA380-900:\n\t\t\tIn November 2007, Airbus top sales executive and chief operating officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant\u2014the A380-900\u2014with more seating space than the A380-800.\n\t\tA380neo:\n\t\t\tOn 15 June 2015, Reuters reported that Airbus was discussing a stretched version of the A380 with a half dozen customers. This aircraft, which could also feature new engines, would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021.\n\t\tA380plus:\n\t\t\tLaunched at the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus offers an A380plus enhanced version with 13% lower costs per seat, featuring up to 80 more seats through better use of cabin space, split scimitar winglets and wing refinements allowing a 4% fuel economy improvement, and longer aircraft maintenance intervals with less downtime.\n\tMarket:\n\t\tSize:\n\t\t\tIn its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus estimated the demand for 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019.\n\t\tFrequency and capacity:\n\t\t\tIn 2013, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines needed to balance frequency and capacity.\n\t\tProduction:\n\t\t\tIn 2005, 270 sales were necessary to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its Internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006.\n\t\tCost:\n\t\t\tAs of 2016 the list price of an A380 is US$432.6 million.\n\t\tSecondary:\n\t\t\tAs of mid-2015, several airlines have expressed their interest in selling their aircraft, partially coinciding with expiring lease contracts for the aircraft. Several A380s which are in service have been offered for lease to other airlines. The suggestion has prompted concerns on the potential for new sales for Airbus, although these were dismissed by Airbus COO John Leahy who stated that \"Used A380s do not compete with new A380s\", stating that the second-hand market is more interesting for parties otherwise looking to buy smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 777.\n\t\tTeardown:\n\t\t\tWith four A380s leased to Singapore Airlines having been returned between October 2017 and March 2018, Dr. Peters fears a weak aftermarket and is considering scrapping them, although they are on sale for a business jet conversion, but on the other hand Airbus sees a potential for African airlines and Chinese airlines, Hajj charters and its large Gulf operators.\n\tOrders and deliveries:\n\t\tEighteen customers have ordered the A380.

From Dubai to Cape Town, Airbus\u2019 activity reflects the company\u2019s slogan: \u201cWe make it fly.\u201d Airbus has a significant presence throughout the region, employing more than 3,100 people across Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. Airbus regional headquarters is in Dubai, also home to Emirates airlines, the largest customer of the flagship A380 jetliner. Airbus\u2019 products and services are widely recognised as being well-suited to Africa and the Middle East, yet the company\u2019s commitment to the region goes beyond selling: Airbus pursues humanitarian objectives and also provides training and support by building local entities, creating jobs and ultimately contributing to the economic development of the region. In addition, Airbus identifies knowledge, skills, talent and capacities that can be developed to address global talent shortages. Airbus sources supplies and components from multiple companies within four African and Middle Eastern countries, and is proud to be a part of a region united in its embrace of innovation to build future prosperity for the generations ahead.\n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tAirbus sold its first aircraft in the Middle East in 1970; as of early 2018, more than 700 Airbus aircraft operate here, and Airbus has signed orders for more than 1,300 aircraft bound for Middle Eastern carriers over the next decade that span the spectrum of the company\u2019s products. Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways all operate the flagship A380 jetliner, and Qatar Airways was the launch operator for the both the A350-1000 and A350-900 variants. Airbus has been making significant inroads into the African aviation market with 28 new Airbus operators since 2010. As of early 2018, around 32 African airlines operate nearly 240 Airbus aircraft, and customers in the region account for more than 260 additional aircraft on the order books. Airbus achieved an 83 percent market share in terms of new aircraft sales in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2016.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tMore than 650 Airbus helicopters are flown by both civil and military operators across Africa and the Middle East in applications as varied as anti-piracy, counter-insurgency, border patrol, emergency medical airlift, search and rescue missions, VIP transport and the servicing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Airbus is further increasing its Middle Eastern footprint with a customer-oriented strategy based on teaming with local partners for helicopter fleet modernisation, overhauling and maintenance. This includes a new technical office in Pakistan, working with the Falcon Aviation Services maintenance centre in the United Arab Emirates and cooperating with AMMROC for helicopter overhauls. Airbus is developing a regional industrial base relying on Eurocopter Kingdom Saudi Arabia, its largest subsidiary located in Saudi Arabia with more than 120 engineers and technicians dedicated to the maintenance, overhaul and modernisation. In Africa, Airbus is broadening and deepening its presence through its regional subsidiary, Airbus Helicopters Southern Africa, which offers aircraft assembly, completions, maintenance, engineering and training. It supports around 150 turbine-powered helicopters operated by customers in 20 countries across the sub-Saharan/Indian Ocean region.\n\tDefence:\n\t\tAirbus is part of the Eurofighter consortium, manufacturer of the world's most advanced combat aircraft \u2013 the Eurofighter Typhoon. As of early 2018, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is acquiring 72 Typhoons; the Sultanate of Oman has ordered 12. As of early 2018, the UAE Air Force and the Royal Saudi Air Force operate three and four Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transports (MRTT), respectively. All told, the defence arm of Airbus has won more than 70 orders for light and medium transport aircraft in the Middle East. As of early 2018, Airbus aircraft are in service in 12 African nations, with Airbus securing 90 orders for light and medium transport aircraft (C212, CN235 and C295) from 18 customers, of which 86 aircraft have been delivered. Egypt is the largest single customer worldwide for the C295 , emphasising the aircraft's suitability for the region due to its exceptional reliability in hot and dusty conditions. In addition, Airbus A400M military transporters in service with the French and German air forces are regularly deployed on peace support and related missions in Africa.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tAirbus offers a wide portfolio of Earth observation satellite capabilities and services to governments and institutions, including the South African National Space Agency, and has built numerous telecom satellites that provide African coverage and enable crucial communications services across the region. These include Egypt\u2019s Nilesat and Algeria\u2019s ALSAT 2A, which has spent more than five years in orbit. For the Kingdom of Morocco, Airbus has the satellite prime contractor role for the MOHAMMED VI-A Earth observation satellite, in charge of its integration, as well as supplying the platform and the ground segment for mission planning and satellite control. This spacecraft is designed for mapping and land surveying activities, regional development, agricultural monitoring, the prevention and management of natural disasters, monitoring changes in the environment and desertification, as well as border and coastal surveillance. Airbus holds a contract with the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates for the development, manufacturing and launch of Falcon Eye, a high-performance optical Earth-observation satellite system.

South Africa\u2019s aerospace industry is a major supplier of parts, components and sub-assemblies that are incorporated across the Airbus product range. \n\tCorporate Citizenship:\n\t\tThe Airbus Foundation works throughout the Africa and the Middle East to advance humanitarian outreach. In coordination with Action Contre la Faim, Emirates airlines regularly utilises deliveries of its Airbus A380 jetliners to transport food and aid to the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai. Ethiopian Airlines transported some 11 tonnes of humanitarian goods destined to provide relief to drought-prone areas in eastern Africa aboard one of its A350 XWBs. In 2017, the Airbus Foundation used an Airbus A330 test aircraft to transport 100 cubic metres, \u2013 some 17 tonnes \u2013  of relief equipment and specialised water and sanitation equipment to Entebbe, Uganda to assist the increasing number of refugees escaping the deteriorating conflict situation in South Sudan. In Airbus\u2019 partnership with South African Airways, educational material and sports equipment have been distributed to children in some of South Africa\u2019s most disadvantaged communities. Rwandair utilised the delivery flight of its second A330 to transport 1.2 tonnes of humanitarian goods, medical supplies, and medical equipment. And in 2017, the Airbus Foundation used an Airbus A330 test aircraft to transport 17 tonnes of relief equipment and specialised water and sanitation equipment to Entebbe, Uganda to assist with the increasing number of refugees escaping the deteriorating conflict situation in South Sudan.\n\tThe future of Africa and the Middle East:\n\t\tCommercial air traffic in Africa and the Middle East is expected to see the biggest growth worldwide in the coming decades, with 5.5 percent annual growth expected in Africa and 6.2 percent annual growth in the Middle East, according to Airbus\u2019 Global Market Forecast. With the increase in air traffic comes a corresponding demand for additional aircraft. In Africa, the Airbus Global Market Forecast translates this into an anticipated need for 1,130 new passenger and freighter aircraft by 2037; the Middle East will require an additional 2,365 new aircraft to meet the forecasted demand.\n"}, {"atitle": "Airbus_in_Canada", "doc": "Airbus in Canada:\n\tFrom its first helicopter manufacturing facility in 1984 to the production of A220 Family single-aisle jetliners today, Airbus has significantly increased its presence in Canada. With nine locations in seven Canadian cities, Airbus has robust industrial activity in the country, covering the commercial jet aircraft, rotorcraft, defence and space sectors. The company\u2019s ties to Canada were strengthened in October 2017 with an Airbus-Bombardier partnership that saw the marketing, manufacturing and support of A220 Family aircraft transferred to Airbus\u2019 stewardship as Bombardier\u2019s two C Series jetliners were brought into the Airbus line-up. Other Airbus companies in Canada include NavBlue, based in Waterloo, Ontario and STELIA Aerospace Group, a multi-specialist aeronautics company with two subsidiaries in Canada. NavBlue is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of navigation charts and data in the aviation market. STELIA North America, based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and Mirabel, Quebec, provides design services, assembly, systems integration, and manufacturing of complex composites and metallic structures, sub-assemblies and components. \n\tCommercial aircraft:\n\t\tAirbus' ties to Canada were deepened in October 2017 when Airbus sought to acquire a majority stake in the C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP), the entity that manufactures and sells Bombardier\u2019s single-aisle C Series jets \u2013 renamed the A220 Family, with its two versions designated the A220-100 and A220-300. The partnership markets, manufactures and supports the A220 Family worldwide. Airbus believes that combining its global reach and scale with Bombardier\u2019s state-of-the-art aircraft and committed CSALP team will unlock the potential of the A220 Family, creating significant new value for customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders. A220 Family jetliners destined for all local and non-U.S. customers worldwide will be produced at the Mirabel final assembly line in Quebec, while A220 Family aircraft meant for U.S. markets will be produced at Airbus\u2019 facility in Mobile, Alabama (currently home to an A320 final assembly line). Airbus jetliners have long been a popular choice of Canadian airlines: Air Canada, as of mid-2018, operates a fleet that includes widebody A330-300s, along with the single-aisle A321-200, A320-200, and A319-100. Air Transat\u2019s widebody fleet comprises A310-300, A330-200, and A330-300 aircraft.\n\tHelicopters:\t\n\t\tHeadquartered in Fort Erie, Ontario, Airbus\u2019 helicopter division has additional facilities in British Columbia and Quebec, supporting more than 200 operators flying 700-plus aircraft.

The government of Canada has a National Master Standing Offer with Airbus that facilitates the purchase of its commercial satellite imagery products and data. Earth-observation data from Airbus is collected using a constellation of company-built state-of-the-art optical and radar satellites. Many Canadian satellites incorporate equipment and systems delivered by Airbus and its subsidiary companies. For example, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited \u2013 the world's leading small satellite company \u2013 provided the agile bus platform used by the Canadian Department of National Defence\u2019s highly successful Sapphire satellite. Airbus also provided equipment, such as the crypto module, GPS receiver, and star trackers, that are used by the Canadian Space Agency\u2019s RCM radar satellites. The Space Systems and Communications, Intelligence and Security divisions of Airbus have successfully addressed many Canadian space requirements in the past. Today, they are well positioned to participate in several significant Canadian space projects (planned as of mid-2018), including SAR Data Continuity, DESSP, ESCP-P, Surveillance of Space 2, and the Terrestrial Snow Mass Mission. Airbus is developing mission concepts and solutions for these and other Canadian space requirements. The CP-140 Aurora long-range maritime patrol aircraft operated by the RCAF will receive equipment upgrades that include the addition of Airbus\u2019 AirPatrol satellite communication terminals to provide high data-rate communications capability that will enhance their intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission performance.\n\tLocal partners: \n\t\tWorking with more than 650 Canadian suppliers across nine provinces in the country, Airbus sources more than $1 billion (Canadian dollars) annually from Canadian companies as of mid-2018 \u2013 spending that supports approximately 17,000 skilled jobs. Canada is ranked ninth globally in terms of Airbus\u2019 supply chain procurement.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus is a frontrunner for innovation and skills in Canada with 48 research and technology projects ongoing or completed in association with the government of Canada\u2019s National Research Council and Canadian universities as of mid-2018. \n\tCorporate citizenship:\n\t\tOne of the ways in which Airbus gives back to the community is by inspiring and encouraging youth development through contact with the aerospace industry. In Canada, to support this mission, Airbus has sponsored an awareness campaign in Montreal, Quebec called \u201cRise to the Future,\u201d developed by A\u00e9ro Montreal, Quebec's aerospace cluster in conjunction with l'\u00c9cole Nationale d'A\u00e9rotechnique in St-Hubert, Quebec, the \u00c9cole des m\u00e9tiers de l'a\u00e9rospatiale de Montr\u00e9al, and the Comit\u00e9 sectoriel de main-d'\u0153uvre en a\u00e9rospatiale. The campaign aims to promote training for Quebecers for careers in booming aerospace sector. Airbus has also supported numerous efforts to improve the lives of Canadians, such as participating in the Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada\u2019s Big Bike charity event in Fort Erie, Ontario to raise funding for critical research to help prevent and treat heart disease and stroke.\n\tCanada's future:\n\t\tWith more than 35 years in Canada and employees coast-to-coast; as well as with the A220 Family partnership, Airbus\u2019 presence in Canada will continue to grow. Canada will become one of five Airbus home countries in the world \u2013 eventually being on par with the U.K., France, Germany and Spain \u2013 meaning there is anticipated growth and opportunity in the aerospace industry for Canada."}, {"atitle": "Airbus_in_China", "doc": "Airbus in China:\n\tAirbus first established an official presence in China in 1994. Since then, rapid growth has been the hallmark of Airbus\u2019 Chinese operations, with the company having expanded its number of commercial jetliners sold to the country by a factor of 50 in less than two decades. The company delivered its 1,000th commercial jetliner in 2013 and aims to reach its 2,000th by 2020, pushing its market share above 50%. With the fast development of its aerospace and aviation industry, China is on track to become the world\u2019s largest aviation market and it is already a major customer of Airbus products, with Chinese deliveries representing nearly a quarter of the company\u2019s global commercial aircraft production. Airbus values not only its relationship with airlines and helicopter operators in China, it also appreciates the enormous value offered by Chinese industry; components produced by Chinese companies are currently found on all production Airbus commercial jetliner types. The total value of the Airbus and Chinese cooperation reached around $500 million in 2015. Beyond its role as both customer and supplier, China is a strategic partner as well, as evidenced by the fact that Airbus\u2019 first final assembly line, or FAL, outside the borders of its four founding European countries was opened in the city of Tianjin in 2008. This FAL produces the A320 single-aisle family of passenger aircraft, and was joined by a Completion and Delivery Centre in 2017 for the A330, marking Airbus\u2019 first widebody jetliner centre outside of its founding countries. \n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tBy late 2017, there were more than 1,500 Airbus commercial jetliners in service in China, and deliveries to the country represent nearly a quarter of Airbus\u2019 total jetliner production. Helping make this possible are more than 1,900 employees in China that work for Airbus and its joint ventures on commercial aircraft in multiple locations across the country. Many of these employees work at the final assembly line in Tianjin. Opened in 2008, the Chinese FAL is a joint venture between Airbus and a consortium of Tianjin Free Trade Zone (TJFTZ) and China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC). As part of this framework, a new Airbus A330 Completion and Delivery Centre (C&DC) in Tianjin was inaugurated in 2017. The C&DC, co-located at the same site as the A320 Family FAL and the Airbus Tianjin Delivery Centre, is Airbus\u2019 first widebody centre outside of Europe. The facility performs A330 completion activities that include cabin installation, aircraft painting, production flight tests, customer acceptance and aircraft delivery.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tAirbus has been China\u2019s No. 1 helicopter partner for more than 50 years, a long-lasting relationship that began in 1967 with the delivery of an Alouette III rotorcraft. Airbus\u2019 helicopter division is the leader in China with a 40% market share as of late 2017. In June 2016, a Chinese consortium ordered 100 H135 light-twin utility helicopters in an agreement that included the construction of an H135 final assembly line (FAL) in Qingdao, Shandong province. Construction began in May, 2017 for what will become the first H135 FAL outside of Europe, as well as the first helicopter final assembly in the country established by a Western helicopter manufacturer. The historic FAL agreement builds on the joint development effort involving Airbus and China\u2019s Avicopter for the H175 medium utility helicopter. Based on an agreement signed in 2014, more than 1,000 of these rotorcraft are envisioned for production over a 20-year timeframe, with the twin-engine helicopter being produced at Airbus\u2019 facility in Marignane, France and in the city of Harbin in northeast China. As of late 2017, Airbus had offices in seven different locations in China for its helicopter-related activities, including a regional customer service centre and logistics platform at Hong Kong airport. Airbus is also one of the major shareholders of CGAMEC, a maintenance company based in Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong, that handles the company\u2019s helicopter maintenance, repair and overhaul activities in China. A full flight simulator for the H225 \u2013 a member of Airbus\u2019 well known Super Puma helicopter family \u2013 was installed in 2012 within the Airbus Hua-Ou training centre in Beijing.\n\tDefence:\t\n\t\tAirbus has forged valuable links with a variety of companies to help it provide better service to a growing local customer base in several areas, while adhering to limitations on military technology. The company has won a number of major contracts in the field of radio communication systems, including providing integrated solutions that guaranteed the security of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Airbus has also deployed TETRA radio systems in airports and metro lines across the country.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tAirbus has been an engaged participant in China\u2019s use of space for Earth observation. The company has also worked with a private partner, Beijing Eastdawn Information Technology (which itself is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), to distribute satellite imagery and software to government agencies and other customers.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tWith headquarters half a world away, Airbus recognises the value that strong partnerships with local Chinese companies provides. A sampling of these partnerships includes a composite manufacturing centre in Harbin, while in Beijing alone, there is an engineering centre; a customer support centre that can dispatch some 25,000 spare parts to airlines in the Asia-Pacific region; and a training centre with five full flight simulators for the A320 and A330/A340 jetliner families and the H225 helicopter.\n\tChina's future:\n\t\tChina is poised to become the world\u2019s largest aviation market in the future, and Airbus is committed to being there every step of the way. The company aims to reach 2,000 aircraft delivered to the country by 2020, pushing its market share above 50%. Recent reforms passed in China will help open lower-altitude airspace in the coming years, handing flight control from the military to civil aviation authorities. With only 900 or so civil helicopters in service in the whole of China (as of late 2017), this will lead to tremendous possibilities for growth; Airbus is well positioned to help put the country on the path to become the world\u2019s largest rotorcraft market with more than 150 deliveries per year expected by 2020."}, {"atitle": "Airbus_in_Finland", "doc": "Airbus in Finland:\n\tMore than 330 highly-skilled employees work at Airbus in Finland, primarily in the area of research and development (R&D), engineering and project management.

In the Earth observation sector is Per\u00faSAT-1 \u2013 a 430 kg.-class satellite built by Airbus for the Peruvian CONIDA space agency and delivered in a record time of less than two years. Equipped with a submetric optical imager also designed and developed by Airbus, the satellite was developed for a wide range of applications ranging from homeland security and border monitoring to disaster management and environmental protection. The most powerful Earth observation satellite operated from Latin America, Per\u00faSAT-1 is based on Airbus\u2019 AstroBus-S platform, the latest generation of high-end satellites. The satellite was lofted in September 2016 by a light-lift Vega launcher operated by Arianespace. Airbus also built the first Earth observation system ever launched for Latin America, the Chilean satellite system FaSat Charlie (Sistema Satelital para Observaci\u00f3n de la Tierra, or SSOT). Orbited in late 2011, the satellite has exceeded its expected five-year functional life. An example of Airbus relay platforms at the service of Latin America is SKY Brasil-1 (also known as SKYB-1), based on the company\u2019s Eurostar E3000 platform. This high-definition television (HDTV) broadcast satellite is used by the DIRECTV Latin America subsidiary of AT&T/DIRECTTV, and offers coverage over Brazil. SKY Brasil-1 was orbited in February 2017 by a heavy-lift Ariane 5 launcher operated by Arianespace \u2013 a subsidiary of ArianeGroup, the joint venture of Airbus and Safran. Another relay platform is SES-10, produced by Airbus for Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES. Launched in 2017, this Eurostar E3000-based spacecraft is used by SES to offer replacement and additional capacity for direct-to-home TV broadcasting, enterprise and mobility services to Central America and South America, Mexico and the Caribbean. \n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 approach to evolve local capabilities in the regions where it does business is illustrated by the Per\u00faSAT-1 imaging satellite, which is part of comprehensive programme that also includes an Airbus-built ground control and image reception and processing segment in the Peruvian National Centre for Satellite Imagery Operation (CNOIS). One of the project\u2019s goals is to develop Peru\u2019s competence in space technologies, satellite operation and appropriate imaging applications, for which Airbus is supplying images from its fleet of optical and radar satellites. More than 80 Peruvian specialists took part in a technology transfer program with Airbus at its Toulouse, France facilities, and in Lima. This gave Peru access to the necessary knowledge and expertise for successful independent operation and maintenance of the Per\u00faSAT-1 systems.\n\tCorporate citizenship:\n\t\tWith the goal of delivering humanitarian aid after a devastating natural disaster, the Airbus Foundation and its customers regularly join forces to provide much-needed humanitarian support. After the devastating 2017 earthquake in Mexico, the Airbus Foundation partnered with Mexican airlines Volaris and Interjet to deliver more than nine tonnes of supplies that included clothes, blankets, tents, tarps, lanterns and medical supplies. LATAM and Azul Brazilian Airlines partnered with the Foundation in a first-of-its kind collaboration to help the victims of devastating Chilean forest fires by transporting relief supplies, and Avianca has partnered with the Foundation to help victims of mudslides in Colombia. Goodwill flights are not the only way the Airbus Foundation provides support to nations impacted by natural disasters. After the 2017 earthquake in Mexico, the Foundation partnered with air ambulance service Angel Flight to provide helicopter emergency transport with two light helicopters of the Ecureuil family \u2013 an AS355 and an H130 \u2013 that were made available to hospitals for the transfer of the critically injured, as well as transportation of food and medicine after the quake rendered many roads impassable. In addition, Airbus Earth-observation satellite images were made available to Foundation partners through a dedicated portal to help assess damage.\n\tLatin America's Future:\n\t\tEconomic indicators remain strong across Latin America and the Caribbean. With well-established democracies in place, increasing urbanisation and rapidly improving infrastructure, the region\u2019s economy is predicted to grow above the world average in the coming decades. The in-service fleet of commercial aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to more than double in the next 20 years, resulting in a need for nearly 50,000 new pilots and more than 53,000 new maintenance engineers. By 2036, the region\u2019s current regional mega cities of Bogot\u00e1, Buenos Aires, Lima, Mexico City, Santiago and S\u00e3o Paulo will be joined by Canc\u00fan, Panama City, and Rio de Janeiro. Together, these nine megacities will account for some 150,000 long-haul passengers daily. Airbus\u2019 long-term prospects for the region are optimistic as the helicopter fleet is estimated to grow 65 percent over the next 20 years resulting in the need of 2,000 new helicopters. The energy sector as well as the public services and  the private transport segments are bound to be particularly dynamic with the H125, H145, H215 and H225 being very well positioned due to their excellent performance in hot and high environments and optimized operational costs. The new H160, which will enter into service next year, is already attracting interest from private customers all over the region thanks to its highly stylized design and state of the art technology."}, {"atitle": "Airbus_in_Russia", "doc": "Airbus in Russia:\n\tOver the past 25 years, Airbus commercial aircraft, helicopters and space products have all established a strong presence in Russia.

In conjunction with offices in Toulouse, France, the support centre provides technical assistance to all operators of Airbus jetliners in Russia and the CIS, whether flying aircraft directly purchased from Airbus or flown on lease. The centre also regularly sets up seminars and conferences for Airbus customers dedicated to various support topics as well as new Airbus services and tools aimed at simplifying the work of technical staff. Airbus manages several projects with the Interstate Aviation Committee, the Russian Civil Aviation Authorities, and the ministry of Transport of Russia and participates in numerous seminars and conferences on the development of flight safety.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tSome 210 Airbus-built rotorcraft were in operation in Russia in the beginning of 2018, and another 70-plus can be found in the countries making up the Commonwealth of Independent States. With a 48 percent market share, Airbus is the largest manufacturer of Western-built turbine-powered helicopters in Russia, and supplies approximately half of the country\u2019s VIP and corporate helicopters as well. Airbus Helicopters Vostok, a wholly-owned Airbus subsidiary, was founded in 2006; it offers a full product portfolio ranging from single-engine light helicopters to medium and heavy transport helicopters. The company has partnered with prominent operators such as the Moscow Aviation Centre, which has a fleet of five light-twin H145s configured for emergency medical services. Airbus is the country\u2019s largest manufacturer of Western-built turbine-powered helicopters in operation in terms of market share. Close strategic partnerships are a key Airbus priority within Russia, as demonstrated by UTair \u2013 one of Russia\u2019s major airlines \u2013 which is operating Airbus rotary-wing aircraft in harsh Siberian conditions. Gazpromavia Aviation has successfully operated eight light-twin H135s in difficult conditions with an excellent fleet availability rate, demonstrating the perfect adaptability of Airbus helicopters for pipeline surveillance and utility missions. Airbus is the only Western manufacturer to offer this level of presence and availability and also is the first to have a Russian partner: Transas, which supplied avionics for the eight H135s, purchased by Gazpromavia before becoming the H135\u2019s avionics supplier upon request. In 2015, Airbus Helicopters Vostok initiated a new strategy involving the creation of a network of maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, and distribution centres for light helicopters. This brought the company\u2019s services in Russia to a new level and added convenience for customers. Heliports of Russia was the first licensed MRO and distribution centre.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tSignificant cooperation with Russia on space projects began in the mid-1990s with the creation of Eurockot, a joint venture between Airbus and Khrunichev Space Centre. The partnership was designed for the promotion and marketing of the Russian small launcher Rockot in the European institutional and commercial markets. Starsem is a joint venture that manages the industrial and commercial exploitation of the Soyuz launch vehicle in the global launch vehicle market; it focuses on the delivery of small satellites and satellite constellations to low- and medium-altitude Earth orbits. In 2005, the Synertech joint venture of Airbus and Russian Space Systems was created to deliver reliable satellite equipment for Russian civil space programs; its production of power amplifiers was officially launched in 2016. Airbus and RSC Energia created the Energia Satellite Technologies joint venture in 2013 to deepen cooperation in the field of satellites. The two companies began collaborating in the early 1990s with equipment supplied to the Mir space station and have continued since, including work on the International Space Station.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tJust as important as the products Airbus sells within Russia are the more than 25 years of industrial cooperation with the country; current cooperation programmes range from material sourcing to engineering and component manufacturing. In 2003, the Airbus Engineering Centre, known as ECAR, was set up in Moscow as a joint venture between Airbus and the Kaskol industrial group. It was Airbus\u2019 first engineering facility outside its home countries and, as of early 2018, employed more than 200 Russian engineers. In this timeframe, ECAR had completed more than 100 projects for Airbus, and work is continuing on the A350-1000, A320neo and A330neo jetliner programmes. The sourcing of raw materials and semi-finished products are key components of Airbus\u2019 business in Russia. The first cooperation agreement with VSMPO-Avisma was signed in the 1990s; in 2009, Airbus built on this foundation by signing a new agreement, valued at $4 billion, that runs until 2020. VSMPO-Avisma supplies titanium forgings for all Airbus programmes. Additionally, the Kamensk-Uralskiy metallurgical plant is supplying aluminium plates in a long-term contract with Airbus. Liebherr Aerospace, in cooperation with Hydromash, produces hydraulic system parts for all Airbus programmes, parts for A350 XWB landing gear, and for A380 flight control systems as well. Hamilton Sundstrand Nauka supplies heat exchangers for the A380\u2019s air generation unit. Airbus remains in constant contact with its Russian industrial partners to evaluate various opportunities for the extension of its supplier base.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus shares its expertise with Russian industry and institutions through partnerships, joint ventures and spin-off companies. Coordinated through links with the Moscow region\u2019s Skolkovo high-tech hub, Airbus has developed key pillars for its ongoing research and technology operations in Russia: simulation and modelling, propulsion, materials development, energy storage and management, telecommunications and in-depth research. Over the past two decades, Airbus has participated in nearly 130 cooperative research ventures.

Airbus has excellent access to high-tech companies, government agencies and financial investment opportunities in Russia.\n\tCorporate citizenship:\n\t\tA socially responsible enterprise, Airbus actively supports numerous education initiatives in the region, including aviation education conferences and cooperation with major aviation universities and schools. In partnership with Moscow State Technical University of Civil Aviation, Airbus specialists created a lecture course for 4th and 5th-grade students that covered various technical aspects of Airbus aircraft. Airbus is also an official partner of the Aviator aviation children\u2019s club in Moscow; this club has practical and theoretical classes for children aged 7-14, where Airbus specialists regularly meet the youngsters to discuss the fascinating world of aviation and Airbus aircraft. Additionally, Airbus partners with key charitable foundations in Russia, organizing joint charity projects involving company employees \u2013 such as visiting ill children in hospitals and speaking to them about aviation topics.\n\tRussia's Future:\n\t\tRussia has one of the leading aircraft industries in the world, where Airbus sees long-term potential for cooperation. Airbus is constantly scouting for new ideas involving not only its major industrial partners in the country, but also universities and start-up companies."}, {"atitle": "Airbus_in_Singapore", "doc": "Airbus in Singapore:\n\tAirbus\u2019 relationship with Singapore dates back to 1975 when the company established a liaison office in the country. As Singapore developed into one of the world\u2019s leading aviation hubs in the years since, Airbus reinforced its presence in the country with cutting-edge products and services. Today, all of Airbus\u2019 business lines can be found in the Southeast Asia city-state. In addition, the company has developed a strong local presence primarily focussed around high value services. The company\u2019s presence in Singapore brings multiple direct benefits to the local economy, with the value of the Airbus sourcing and activities in the country reaching almost SGD 1 billion per year. All told, Airbus employs more than 700 staff locally, many in highly skilled positions.\n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tAs of early 2018, Airbus had sold more than 600 civil passenger aircraft to airlines and leasing companies in Singapore, making the country one of Airbus\u2019 top five markets in the region. Customers include Singapore Airlines and its subsidiaries Scoot and Silkair, as well as leading Asian lessor BOC Aviation. Together they have placed orders across the Airbus commercial aircraft product line, including the flagship A380 double deck jetliner, the popular and versatile A330 widebody, the all-new long-haul A350 XWB and the best-selling single-aisle A320 Family. Singapore Airlines first became an Airbus customer in May 1979 with an order for the A300B4, the original widebody twinjet aircraft. Since then, the airline has placed orders for more than 140 widebody aircraft from the company. The carrier was the launch customer for the A380 following the aircraft\u2019s entry into service in 2007, and ten years later, Singapore Airlines received the first of its jetliners with an upgraded and improved cabin product that elevates the passenger experience to new heights. The carrier operates 19 A380s (as of early 2018), with another four on order, on routes to key points in Europe, the US and selected destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. In January 2009, Singapore Airlines added the popular A330-300 to its fleet under lease agreements. As of early 2018, the airline has 22 A330s in service, operating across the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. Singapore Airlines has ordered 67 A350 aircraft (as of early 2018), which have become the backbone of its widebody fleet. The carrier\u2019s first A350-900 entered service in 2016, and as of early 2018 it has 20 of the type operating on long-haul services to Europe and Africa, as well as key destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2018, the airline will also receive seven Ultra Long Range A350s with a flying capability of up to 20 hours, allowing the carrier to re-launch the world\u2019s longest non-stop passenger services, linking Singapore to points in the US. A320 Family jetliners are the product of choice for both full-service and low-cost carriers, operated by Silkair, Scoot and Jetstar Asia. In 2014, low-cost carrier Tigerair \u2013 which later merged with Scoot \u2013 ordered 39 A320neo aircraft to support its future growth plans. The first aircraft are due to arrive later in 2018. Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation placed its first order with Airbus in 1996 with a deal for 12 aircraft from the A320 Family. Since then, the company has become a major Airbus customer with orders as of early 2018 for 324 aircraft from both the A330 and A320 Families.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tAirbus has supplied various models of rotorcraft to the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), including large transport Super Pumas. In 2016, Singapore\u2019s defence ministry signalled its confidence in the H225M Super Puma with a new order to meet its future medium lift requirements. Singapore-based Airbus Helicopters Southeast Asia is responsible for sales and customer support activities for the entire helicopter product line in 15 territories in the region. Its activities include new completions and deliveries, maintenance and inspection, modification and retrofit, sale of spares, and training courses for technicians and pilots.\n\tDefence:\n\t\tIn 2014, Singapore announced an order for the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) to conduct air-to-air refuelling, as well as undertake civil transport and disaster relief missions. Deliveries of the MRTT will begin in 2018.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tThe company\u2019s success in Singapore also extends to space applications. Airbus provided the first telecommunications satellite to Singtel, and this was launched in 1998. Airbus also helped Singapore become the global leader in the near equatorial domain and is proud to have contributed to Singapore\u2019s recent successes via the TeLEOS-1 national programme with key equipment and leading-edge test campaigns. Building on this successful collaboration, Airbus is actively participating in the upcoming TeLEOS-2 satellite. Airbus DS Geo, part of the company\u2019s space division, focuses on satellite imagery distribution throughout Asia. Recognised as a world leader in geo-information, the team in Singapore provides access for Asian institutions and partners to the Pl\u00e9iades, SPOT, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites and constellations.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tBeyond its commercial achievements, Airbus has established a dominant presence in Singapore with several locally incorporated companies that focus on regional customer support, maintenance and training operations. Airbus Asia Training Centre, a joint venture owned 55 percent by Airbus and 45 percent by Singapore Airlines, began operations at the Seletar Aerospace Park in April 2016 and offers training courses for all in-production Airbus aircraft. When fully operational later in 2018 with eight full-flight simulators, it will be the largest Airbus-operated flight crew training facility in the world. Also located within the Seletar Aerospace Park are Airbus Services Asia Pacific, which manages the company\u2019s customer support and customer service activities for operators in the region, and Satair Airbus Singapore Centre, the primary spare parts hub for Airbus aircraft with operators in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2016, Airbus and SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) incorporated a new joint venture maintenance and overhaul unit, Heavy Maintenance Singapore Services (HMS Services). SIAEC holds a 65 percent equity stake in HMS Services, with Airbus holding the remaining 35 percent. This new company has begun providing consultancy services to SIAEC, and is expected to start A380 heavy maintenance in the third quarter of 2018. Airbus sourcing activities are growing in Singapore with the procurement of aircraft services, cabin and engine parts, systems and equipment through various suppliers. They include SIA Engineering Company, ST Engineering and the local units of Honeywell, Rolls-Royce, Safran, Thales and United Technologies. The company also has an important global partnership with ST Aerospace, a subsidiary of Singapore-listed ST Engineering, for the passenger-to-freighter conversion of Airbus A330 and A320 Family aircraft. ST Aerospace leads the marketing of the conversion programmes worldwide, with the actual conversion work carried out at various ST Aerospace facilities and at an jointly owned subsidiary EFW in Germany. EFW delivered the first converted A330-300 \n\t\tfreighter in December 2017.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus has also identified Singapore as a strategic partner for advanced research and innovation initiatives. These include programmes in collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore University of Technology and Design, as well as government agencies such as the Economic Development Board and A*Star. Airbus has two major projects currently underway in Singapore. The first is Skyways, which is a project to develop a safe and economically viable unmanned aerial parcel delivery system for use in urban environments. The project was launched in Singapore in February 2016 in association with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and NUS, and SingPost became a logistics partner in 2017. By working together with its Singapore partners, Airbus aims to ensure that the solutions developed will address the future logistics needs of cities around the world. The project is now at an advanced stage and trials involving the prototype drone are set to begin in NUS in 2018. The second is the Hangar of the Future, which is focussed on harnessing the latest digital technologies and autonomous inspection systems to reboot the maintenance, repair and overhaul business, significantly increasing operational efficiency for airlines. This project was launched in 2016 in association with Temasek Polytechnic, and several Singapore start-ups. The project is co-funded by Airbus and the Economic Development Board, and trials are ongoing at a test-bed hangar in the Temasek Polytechnic. A key element in the project is the huge amounts of data generated by the aircraft in service, which will be collected and analysed via Airbus\u2019 open data platform, Skywise. This will enable MROs to predict the required maintenance tasks for a given aircraft, helping to optimise planning and maintenance task execution and minimising aircraft on-ground time. \n\tSingapore's future: \n\t\tAirbus and Singapore have been strategic partners for more than 40 years, and this has been a highly successful relationship. Airbus plans to develop further its presence here in the years to come."}, {"atitle": "Airbus_in_Spain", "doc": "Airbus in Spain:\n\tSpain's aviation industry dates back to 1923 when Jos\u00e9 Ortiz-Echag\u00fce founded Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas, SA. The company, known by the initials CASA, went on to design and manufacture aircraft and become a pioneering presence in European aviation cooperation. Having worked successfully on earlier Airbus projects, CASA became part of Airbus in 2000. Today, Airbus is the leader of Spain\u2019s aerospace and defence sector, generating 56.4% of the nation\u2019s revenues in these areas through the work of some 12,700 employees. Production facilities for Airbus commercial aircraft, military aircraft, helicopters, and space activities can be found within the country.\n\tCommercial Aircraft:\n\t\tAirbus operations in Spain, employing approximately 3,400 employees, produces the horizontal stabilisers for the entire range of Airbus commercial aircraft at its facilities in Getafe, Illescas, and Puerto Real, among other components.

For nearly 30 years, Airbus has been an important partner for the country, working closely with flag carrier Turkish Airlines, the Ministry of Defence and Undersecretary for Defence Industries, as well as Turkey\u2019s air force, navy and coast guard. Investments and partnerships \u2013 which have created more than 3,000 jobs in Turkey as of mid-2018 \u2013 have only strengthened the relationship and will continue to do so as the country\u2019s industrial workforce steadily grows. By the year 2020, Airbus will have invested nearly $2.5 billion in Turkey and by 2030, that figure will soar to over $5 billion. These investments have returned concrete dividends: every commercial and military Airbus aircraft flying today has parts produced by Turkish suppliers. Not only are components manufactured in Turkey, but increasingly so are more complex major assemblies. Turkish suppliers also have assumed design responsibilities for such parts and assemblies as ailerons for the A350 XWB Family and control surfaces for a number of commercial and military aircraft platforms.\n\tCommercial aircraft:\n\t\tTurkey is Airbus\u2019 fourth-largest customer in Europe, with some 270 passenger and freighter aircraft in service with nine operators (as of 2018), with more on order. Airbus aircraft share cockpit and operational commonality, allowing airlines to use the same pool of pilots, cabin crews and maintenance engineers, while bringing operational flexibility that results in significant cost savings. Several airlines in Turkey benefit from these advantages by operating more than one Airbus aircraft type in their fleet. According to Airbus\u2019 Global Market Forecast for 2018-2037, passenger numbers on domestic routes will triple in the country over the next 20 years, with soaring demand for over 900 aircraft. With approximately 270 Airbus passenger and freighter aircraft in service with nine operators, Turkey is Airbus\u2019 fourth-largest customer in Europe.\n\tHelicopters:\n\t\tTurkey has proved an important market for Airbus helicopters. Significant military contracts were signed in the 1990s for the delivery of AS532 Cougar helicopters to the Turkish armed forces. As of mid-2018, Turkey is the world\u2019s largest Cougar operator with a fleet of 46 such helicopters operated by the Turkish Land Forces and the Air Force for general purpose and search-and-rescue missions. Airbus has a strong presence in the parapublic emergency medical services segment in Turkey with 13 H135 helicopters operated by the Turkish Aeronautical Association for the needs of the Turkish Ministry of Health across the country. Several civil Airbus helicopter models also are flying in Turkey, such as the single-engine H130 and twin-engine H145, used in roles that include passenger transport and business aviation.\n\tDefence:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 defence and security presence in Turkey was established in 2013, providing sales and marketing support, along with support in the contractual, material and services sectors. This operation is actively playing a role in services and modernisation for the Turkish Air Force\u2019s A400M multi-role airlifter, as well as providing material support for the CN235 tactical transport. The Turkish Armed Forces are one of the pioneer air forces operating the A400M airlifter and also fly the largest fleet of CN235 transport aircraft. Every commercial and military Airbus aircraft flying today has parts produced by Turkish suppliers.\n\tSpace:\n\t\tIn late 2017, Airbus was awarded the contract for the T\u00fcrksat 5A and 5B telecommunication satellites, which are based on the latest Electric Orbit Raising (EOR) version of its highly-reliable Eurostar E3000 platform. The company continues along its path to become an integral part of the Turkish space industry by supporting various projects. Indeed, Airbus is uniquely positioned as a potential partner with the future Turkish Space Agency, able to open the door to the European Space Agency with perspectives encompassing research, development and commercial opportunities.\n\tLocal partners:\n\t\tTurkish aeronautical industries work to ensure the highest level of capabilities and skills, and Airbus is likewise focused on the continued development of long-term aviation cooperation projects. Rate increases for the A320 and A350 XWB jetliner families will create additional jobs, and Turkish aeronautical industries will benefit from added responsibilities resulting from the continuous development of its strategic skills. Airbus has seven major industrial partners and subsidiaries in Turkey.\n\tInnovation:\n\t\tAirbus\u2019 goal is to continuously push the boundaries for new and better methods to apply the most advanced technology to continuously innovate its products, business and services. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and Airbus signed, in September 2018, a Cooperation and Research agreement to co-develop and engage in research and experimentation in aircraft secondary structures, such as movable parts, for Airbus programs. By combining resources and knowledge to develop data-driven capabilities, TAI and Airbus will gain insights into advanced manufacturing methods for cost-effective and environmentally-friendly aircraft. Launched in January 2018 by Turkish Airlines, \u0130bn Haldun University and Airbus, \u201cAir Transport Management Master\u2019s Program\u201d is a comprehensive 18-month academic course designed to provide future aviation executives with sufficient capabilities to run the region\u2019s fast-growing aerospace industry. The program is endowed by globally reputable institutions like Cranfield University and British Columbia University, and is held at the Turkish Airlines Aviation Academy Campus.\n\tTurkey's Future:\n\t\tAirbus considers Turkey a strategic industrial partner and is committed to long-term, mutually-beneficial industrial cooperation through the placement of work packages that include technology transfers. Such transfers help build skills and competencies in the country\u2019s aviation industry. Airbus\u2019 Global Market Forecast for 2018-2037 predicts that over the coming 20 years, passenger traffic to, from and within Turkey will more than triple. Airbus is extremely well-positioned to meet this demand with its eco-efficient, modern aircraft families, and Turkish aerospace companies are equally well-positioned to benefit from this growth through long-term industrial partnerships with Airbus.

It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures in multiple countries both inside and outside of the European Union. The company has three divisions: Commercial Aircraft, Defence and Space, and Helicopters, the third being the largest in its industry in terms of revenues and turbine helicopter deliveries.The company's main civil aeroplane business is based in Blagnac, France, a suburb of Toulouse, with production and manufacturing facilities mainly in France, Germany, Spain, China, United Kingdom and the United States. Final assembly production is based at Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Seville, Spain; Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, United States. The company produces and markets the first commercially viable digital fly-by-wire airliner, the Airbus A320, and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380. The 10,000th aircraft, an A350, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 14 October 2016. The global Airbus fleet have performed more than 110 million flights, totaling over 215 billion kilometres and carrying 12 billion passengers. Airbus's corporate headquarters is located in Leiden, Netherlands, and the main office is located in Toulouse, France. The company is led by CEO Thomas Enders and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.\n\tFormerly:\n\t\tPre-2017 parent company:\n\t\tEuropean Aeronautic Defence and Space Company NV (2000\u20132014), Airbus Group NV (2014\u20132015), Airbus Group SE (2015\u20132017)\n\t\tPre-2017 subsidiary:\n\t\tAirbus Industrie GIE (1970\u20132001), Airbus SAS (2001\u20132017)\n\tHistory:\n\t\tThe current company is the product of consolidation in the European aerospace industry tracing back to the formation of the Airbus Industrie GIE consortium in 1970. In 2000, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) NV was established. In addition to other subsidiaries pertaining to security and space activities, EADS owned 100% of the pre-existing Eurocopter SA, established in 1992, as well as 80% of Airbus Industrie GIE. In 2001, Airbus Industrie GIE was reorganised as Airbus SAS, a simplified joint-stock company. In 2006, EADS acquired BAE Systems's remaining 20% of Airbus. EADS NV was renamed Airbus Group NV and SE in 2014, and 2015, respectively.Due to the dominance of the Airbus SAS division within Airbus Group SE, these parent and subsidiary companies were merged in January 2017, keeping the name of the parent company. The company was given its present name in April 2017.\n\tLogo:\n\t\tThe logos of Airbus Industrie GIE and Airbus SAS displayed a stylised turbine symbol, redolent of a jet engine, and a font similar to Helvetica Black. The logo colours were reflected in the standard Airbus aircraft livery in each period. The EADS logo between 2000 and 2010 combined the logos of the merged companies, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (a four-ray star) and A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra (a curved arrow), after which these elements were removed and a new font with 3D shading was chosen. This font was retained in the logos of Airbus Group NV (2014\u20132015) and Airbus Group SE (2015\u20132017), then Airbus SE:\n\tCivilian products:\n\t\tThe Airbus product line started with the A300, the world's first twin-aisle, twin-engined aircraft. A shorter, re-winged, re-engined variant of the A300 is known as the A310. Building on its success, Airbus launched the A320, particularly notable for being the first commercial jet to use a fly-by-wire control system. The A320 has been, and continues to be, a great commercial success. The A318 and A319 are shorter derivatives with some of the latter under construction for the corporate business jet market as Airbus Corporate Jets. A stretched version is known as the A321. The A320 family's primary competitor is the Boeing 737 family. The longer-range widebody products\u2014 the twin-jet A330 and the four-engine A340\u2014 have efficient wings, enhanced by winglets. The Airbus A340-500 has an operating range of 16,700 kilometres (9,000 nmi), the second longest range of any commercial jet after the Boeing 777-200LR (range of 17,446 km or 9,420 nautical miles). All Airbus aircraft developed since then have cockpit systems similar to the A320, making it easier to train crew. Production of the four-engine A340 was ended in 2011 due to lack of sales compared to its twin-engine counterparts, such as the Boeing 777. Airbus is studying a replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed NSR, for \"New Short-Range aircraft\". Those studies indicated a maximum fuel efficiency gain of 9\u201310% for the NSR. Airbus however opted to enhance the existing A320 design using new winglets and working on aerodynamical improvements. This \"A320 Enhanced\" should have a fuel efficiency improvement of around 4\u20135%, shifting the launch of an A320 replacement to 2017\u20132018. On 24 September 2009, the COO Fabrice Bregier stated to Le Figaro that the company would need from \u20ac800 million to \u20ac1 billion over six years to develop the new aircraft generation and preserve the company technological lead from new competitors like the Chinese Comac C919, scheduled to operate by 2015\u20132020. In July 2007, Airbus delivered its last A300 to FedEx, marking the end of the A300/A310 production line. Airbus intends to relocate Toulouse A320 final assembly activity to Hamburg, and A350/A380 production in the opposite direction as part of its Power8 organisation plan begun under ex-CEO Christian Streiff. Airbus supplied replacement parts and service for Concorde until its retirement in 2003. The Airbus Corporate Jets markets and modifies new aircraft for private and corporate customers. It has a model range that parallels the commercial aircraft offered by the company, ranging from the A318 Elite to the double-deck Airbus A380 Prestige. Following the entry of the 737 based Boeing Business Jet, Airbus joined the business jet market with the A319 Corporate Jet in 1997. Although the term Airbus Corporate jet was initially used only for the A319CJ, it is now often used for all models, including the VIP widebodies. As of December 2008, 121 corporate and private jets are operating, 164 aircraft have been ordered, including an A380 Prestige and 107 A320 family Corporate Jet.\n\tConsumer products:\n\t\tIn June 2013, Airbus announced that it was developing a range of \"smart suitcases\" known as Bag2Go for air travellers, in conjunction with luggage-maker Rimowa and IT firm T-Systems. The cases feature a collection of built-in electronic gadgets which communicate with a smartphone app and with the IT systems of the airline, to assist the traveller and improve reliability and security of baggage handling. Gadgets include a weighing scale and a location tracker, using GPS for location tracking, RFID for identification, and a SIM card for messaging. Since then, similar products have been announced by other companies.\n\tMilitary products:\n\t\tIn the late 1990s Airbus became increasingly interested in developing and selling to the military aviation market. It embarked on two main fields of development: aerial refuelling with the Airbus A310 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) and the Airbus A330 MRTT, and tactical airlift with the A400M. In January 1999 Airbus established a separate company, Airbus Military SAS, to undertake development and production of a turboprop-powered tactical transport aircraft, the Airbus Military A400M. The A400M is being developed by several NATO members, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the UK, as an alternative to relying on foreign aircraft for tactical airlift capacity, such as the Ukrainian Antonov An-124 Ruslan and the American C-130 Hercules. The A400M project has suffered several delays; Airbus has threatened to cancel the development unless it receives state subsidies. Pakistan placed an order for the Airbus A310 MRTT in 2008, which will be a conversion of an existing airframe as the base model A310 is no longer in production. On 25 February 2008 Airbus won an order for three air refuelling MRTT aircraft, adapted from A330 passenger jets, from the United Arab Emirates. On 1 March 2008 a consortium of Airbus and Northrop Grumman had won a $35 billion contract to build the new in-flight refuelling aircraft KC-45A, a US built version of the MRTT, for the USAF. The decision drew a formal complaint from Boeing, and the KC-X contract was cancelled to begin bidding afresh.\n\tNew supersonic passenger plane:\n\t\tIn September 2014, Aerion partnered with Airbus (mainly Airbus Defence) to collaborate on designing the Aerion AS2, a supersonic 11-seater private business jet, hoping for a market entry in 2021.\n\tEnvironmental record:\n\t\tAirbus has committed to the \"Flightpath 2050\", an aviation industry plan to reduce noise, CO2, and NOx emissions. Airbus was the first aerospace business to become ISO 14001 certified, in January 2007; this is a broader certification covering the whole organisation, not just the aircraft it produces. In association with Honeywell and JetBlue Airbus has developed a biofuel to reduce pollution and dependence on fossil fuels, claiming that this has the potential to replace up to a third of the world's aviation fuel. Algae-based biofuel absorbs carbon dioxide during growth and does not compete with food production. This alternative may be commercially available by 2030 but algae and other vegetation-based fuels are in an early stage of development and fuel-bearing algae has been expensive to develop. Airbus offers delivery flights to airlines using a 10% biofuel blend in standard engines. The fuel does not cut carbon emissions but is free of sulphur emissions and demonstrates that the fuel could be used in commercial flights in unmodified engines.\n\tOrganisation:\n\t\tDivisions:\n\t\t\tCommercial aircraft:\n\t\t\t\tCommercial aircraft generated 67% of total revenue for the group in 2013. The product portfolio of such aircraft encompasses short range models such as the A320 family and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380.\n\t\t\tDefence and Space:\n\t\t\t\tThe division Airbus Defence and Space was formed in January 2014 as part of the group restructuring from the former EADS divisions Airbus Military, Astrium, and Cassidian (composed of Cassidian Electronics \u2013 develops and manufactures sensors, radars, avionics and electronic warfare systems for military and security applications, Cassidian Air Systems \u2013 develops manned and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs), mission avionics, electronic defence and warning systems and Cassidian Systems \u2013 provides global security solutions such as command & control, lead system integration, TETRA and TETRAPOL communication systems for public safety, industry, transportation and defence. This line of business was the first one in the world to begin field tests with TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS). EADS 3 Sigma \u2013 a Hellenic company focused in the design, development, production and services provision of airborne and surface target drone systems. The Airbus Military division, which manufactured tanker, transport and mission aircraft; Eurocopter, the world's largest helicopter supplier; Astrium, provided systems for aerial, land, naval and civilian security applications including Ariane, Galileo and Cassidian. Through Cassidian, EADS was a partner in the Eurofighter consortium as well as in the missile systems provider MBDA.\n\t\t\tHelicopters:\n\t\t\t\tAirbus Helicopters, formerly known as Eurocopter, is a helicopter manufacturing and support company. See also: Airbus Helicopters, Inc.\n\tInternational manufacturing presence:\n\t\tAirbus has several final assembly lines for different models and markets. These are:\n\t\tToulouse, France (A320, A330 family, A350 family and A380)\n\t\tHamburg, Germany (A318, A319, A320 and A321)\n\t\tSeville, Spain (A400M)\n\t\tTianjin, China (A319 and A320).\n\t\tMobile, Alabama, US (A319, A320 and A321)\n\t\tMirabel, Canada (A220)\n\t\tAirbus, however, has a number of other plants in different European locations, reflecting its foundation as a consortium. An original solution to the problem of moving aircraft parts between the different factories and the assembly plants is the use of the Airbus Beluga, a modified cargo aircraft capable of carrying entire sections of fuselage. This solution has also been investigated by Boeing, which retrofitted 4 747-400s to transport the components of the 787. An exception to this scheme is the A380, whose fuselage and wings are too large\n\tFinancial information:\n\t\tIn October 2005 the British Ministry of Defence warned European politicians to stop, as it sees it, interfering in the corporate governance of EADS. The former UK Defence Procurement Minister Lord Drayson hinted that the UK government, a major customer for EADS, may withhold future contracts. \"As a key customer, we see it as important for EADS to move in a direction that is free from political interference.\"\n"}]
